The series is set in the aftermath of the original&nbsp;Power&nbsp;series and chronicles Tariq St. Patrick played by Michael Rainey Jr., grappling with his new reality.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The original series ran for six seasons, and Rainey was only 12 years old when he started on the show. He had a minor role until season three. After that, Rainey’s Tariq became an important series regular, and the most hated villain in the complicated&nbsp;Power&nbsp;universe.&nbsp;</p><p>Tariq is trying to get his mother, Tasha St. Patrick (Naturi Naughton), released from prison while juggling his role as a college student and working as a drug dealer in the spinoff.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Now at 20 years old and&nbsp;the current face of the ever-growing&nbsp;Power&nbsp;Universe, he has caught the attention of fans and media, and his personal life has been put under a microscope.&nbsp;Everyone is curious about who the actor is dating.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Fans Are Rooting for Rainey and Hurd</h2><p>In his titular series, Rainey's character is caught in a love triangle between two women, Lauren Baldwin (<a href=# rel=follow>Paige Hurd</a>), a classmate from his prestigious Ivy League university, and Diana Tejada (LaToya Tonodeo), the daughter of drug queenpin Monet Tejada (Mary J. Blige) who is Tariq’s boss.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In real life, however, it appears that Rainey is not dating anyone at the moment, and fans seem to have taken the opportunity to encourage Rainey to get together with Hurd.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On July 21, Rainey uploaded a collage of him and Hurd and wished her a happy birthday. The comment section was flooded with inquisitive fans who asked the actor if they were dating.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan inquired&nbsp;“Mane y'all dating or nah,” while another wrote, “If you want her just say that.” It appears many fans want them to date, but a few were skeptical because of the age gap between them. The co-stars&nbsp;have a nine-year gap between them.&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another earlier post</a>&nbsp;by Rainey, he and Hurd appeared to be in a semi-hug, and both of them were flashing broad smiles. The comments section was again filled with fans asking Rainey to get together with Hurd. However,&nbsp;some of Rainey's die-hard fans were not happy about it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Rainey’s Previous Relationship</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>If Rainey&nbsp;does end up dating Hurd, she won’t be his first girlfriend.&nbsp;In 2019, it was reported that Rainey was dating the then-18-year-old Ugandan model Eva Apio, daughter of the famous Ugandan supermodel Eva Mbabazi.&nbsp;</p><p>The two of them refrained from talking about each other in interviews, but on Instagram, they were public about their relationship. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to reports</a>, the two of them had posted several intimate pictures of each other on their accounts.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Although the couple never publicly talked about their breakup, it was clear they had gone their separate ways after both of them deleted posts of one another from&nbsp;their Instagram accounts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>No one knows the reason for their breakup, as it was&nbsp;very much behind closed doors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWZmLWisctmqZqhnprGbrbRZqeaoZeaeqnB0Z1knZmknruoecaiqaWeop6yr7CNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./roccibella-19940216-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Roccibella (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./casey-abrams-hospitalized-feeling-better.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Casey Abrams: Hospitalized, Feeling Better</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
