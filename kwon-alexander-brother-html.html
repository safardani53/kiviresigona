All the while, it was rage that got him through the game. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How Kwon Alexander Knew about Brother's Death</h2><p>Alexander was getting some much-needed downtime the Friday before his upcoming match with the Atlanta Falcons. The date was&nbsp;October 30, 2015.</p><p>A phone call interrupted him while he decided where to get dinner that night. It was his mother, Peaches Taylor, on the other side of the line.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In a faint voice, his mother told him how his brother had got shot. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Players' Tribune</a> piece, he recalled the moment, writing he felt as if everything had stopped. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"It was like all the air got sucked out of the room and the lights went out," he said of the moment. While he felt as if everything stopped, his mother had started her prayers under her breath.</p><p>Broderick Jr. was clinging to his life. Peaches asked Alexander to pray and left for the hospital. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He did not think Broderick would die. He had this "feeling" that he would make it out alive.</p><p>So he went to get dinner, all the while waiting for his mom to call back with some good news. He kept trying to convince himself that Broderick would be all right.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>About 30 minutes later, Peaches called him and said only two words — "He's gone." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Alexander said he went blank and remembered crying until he could not anymore.</p><p>Broderick, or Lil' Brod, as everyone&nbsp;called him, was 17 at the time —&nbsp;almost 18. With his birthday right around the corner, he had gotten into a fight that night.</p><p>The situation escalated, and somebody shot him in the chest. Bystanders at the scene told him that Broderick's eyes gave away his death right at that moment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Alexander spoke highly of his brother in his writing. "He was the goofy kid who loved life and wanted everybody to be happy and smile," he said.</p><p>They were in contact throughout his time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He had been drafted by the Bucs just that May.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Broderick was his biggest fan and kept asking for a jersey with Alexander's name on it. He also asked for advice on football or girls. "He was my guy," Alexander remembered of his brother.</p><p>Alexander had promised he would get him one. He expressed his grief for not being able to keep his promise. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Kwon Alexander's Game after Brother's Death</h2><p>Alexander's game with the Falcons was supposed to be his homecoming as his whole family had planned to go watch him play. He grew up in Oxford, Alabama, and the stadium he was playing was just a 90-minute drive away.</p><p>But he did not want to play. He was hurting, and so was his whole family. Alexander was ready to book a flight back to Alabama and skip the game.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He had his team's support to skip. His mother asked him to do otherwise.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She forbade him from going home. "Brod would have wanted you to play. So you go play," Peaches told him.</p><p>"And I played the game of my life," he recalled of the game against the Falcons.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Kwon Alexander played the game of his life against the Atlanta Falcons days after his brother died in 2015.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>He drove his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">team to victory</a> with 11 tackles, an interception, and a fumble recovery. The Bucs won 23-20 overtime.</p><p>In his The Players' Tribune writing, he said he was more focused on a game than he had ever been. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also made a "weird" comparison — Alexander compared his mentality to Bobby's from the <a href=# rel=follow>Adam Sandler</a> movie The Waterboy.</p><p>Alexander pretended that "whoever had the ball was the person responsible for taking my little brother away from me and my family."&nbsp;He was out to destroy everyone with a red shirt.</p><p>Know mentioned Broderick was with him&nbsp;throughout the game. He encouraged his big brother the entire game, making Alexander do things he would later have to pause and comprehend.</p><p>Nobody but his auntie could make it there to see him have the best game of his career till that day.</p><p>His brother's death changed his perspective on game and life.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tampa Magazines</a> in 2018, he said he thought about Broderick every morning. The incident made him happy to be alive.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He confessed he felt&nbsp;Broderick's&nbsp;presence all the time, and that made him feel undefeated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Alexander even got a tattoo that says "All You Wanted Me to Do Was Ball" in Broderick's&nbsp;memory.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOnpLturcuer5qmlJq%2Fbq7RqKuhnaJjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-wayne-big-jerk-rapper-stiffs-kids-at-concert.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rapper Stiffs Kids at Concert</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brett-jones-songwriter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Brett Jones (songwriter) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
