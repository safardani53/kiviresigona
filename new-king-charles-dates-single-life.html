Fleet Street scribes as the “world’s most eligible bachelor”.</p><p>The picture caused a sensation across continents and was a glimpse of the excitement that would be generated when he finally chose the woman he would marry.</p><p>It later emerged that Jane Priest’s stolen kiss was a put-up job by a newspaper.</p><p>Yet the clamour — from his family and public opinion — for him to finally settle down was reaching fever pitch.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Queen's Death">Read More On The Queen's Death</h2><p>In the 1970s, protocol dictated that for an heir to the throne, a suitable bride meant either a foreign princess or the daughter of a senior British aristocrat.</p><p>But <a href=#>Charles</a> had long heeded the advice of his mentor, great-uncle and godfather, the last Viceroy of India, <a href=#>Lord Mountbatten</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Mountbatten</a> counselled on Valentine’s Day 1974 when <a href=#>Charles</a> was 25: “In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down.</p><p>“But for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Royal</h2></p><p>“It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.”</p><p>Socially shy and awkward, with jug ears and a weak chin, <a href=#>Charles</a> was not classic Casanova material.</p><p>Yet while studying at Cambridge he discovered he had a way with the opposite sex.</p><p>Aged 19, the Prince had his first serious romance, with <a href=#>Lucia Santa Cruz</a>, the daughter of the Chilean Ambassador to London.</p><p>Lord “Rab” Butler, the Master of Trinity College where the Prince was studying, is said to have slipped Lucia a key to his lodge to allow her and Charles to be together.</p><p>As Butler’s wife Mollie put it, Charles “cut his teeth” on Lucia.</p><p>Their relationship lasted from 1968 to 1970 but they remained friends and Lucia was invited to his second wedding.</p><p>According to Coronation Street and Carry On Cleo star <a href=#>Amanda Barrie</a>, it was she who had been lined up to pop Charles’s cherry.</p><p>She claimed that the actor James Robertson Justice, a friend of <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>, asked her to his house in <a href=#>Scotland</a> to meet the young Charles, then at Gordonstoun school, to “help in the initiation of the future king”.</p><p>Amanda revealed that James, an upper-crust star who played Sir Lancelot Spratt in 1960 comedy Doctor In Love, said it was the “ultimate compliment, but don’t be offended by it”.</p><p>Amanda added: “He said he was one of eight people who had been selected to help ‘launch the royal males into their future life’.</p><p>“He actually said, ‘We don’t really want people who are experienced but, on the other hand, well, obviously they have to know the ropes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

got that.”</p><p>No cash was offered. Amanda would be doing it for the privilege. But it was not to be.</p><p>Recalling the proposal, Amanda said: “I had this terrible image of having to face the <a href=#>Queen</a> over breakfast. What would she say? ‘So, Amanda, how was it?’.”</p><p>When she turned the actor down, he told her, “Please don’t tell anyone”. So she did not for years.</p><p><a href=#>Charles</a> graduated from Cambridge with a 2:2 in June 1970, the first heir to the throne to earn a university degree.</p><p>He then embarked on a military career befitting a future monarch.</p><p>In his second year at Cambridge he had trained with the RAF, and in March 1971, he flew himself to RAF College Cranwell to train as a jet pilot.</p><p>After the passing-out parade that September, he then followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and embarked on a naval career</p><p>He enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth before serving on the guided-missile destroyer HMS Norfolk and the frigates HMS Minerva and HMS Jupiter between 1971 and 1974.</p><p>When Jupiter docked in San Diego, <a href=#>California</a>, Charles met Laura Jo Watkins.</p><p>She was the daughter of a US admiral who had been unable to make it to the welcome party and had sent her instead.</p><p>Beautiful and blonde, Laura Jo went on several dates with Charles and wrote to him afterwards, but as a Roman Catholic she was never suitable royal marriage material.</p><img

speech in the House of Lords but the romance fizzled out after a weekend in <a href=#>France</a>.</p><p>In 1974, <a href=#>Charles</a> qualified as a helicopter pilot then joined 845 Naval Air Squadron, operating from HMS Hermes.</p><p>In February 1976, he took command of coastal minehunter HMS Bronington for his last ten months of active service.</p><p>While on Bronington, he dated a

aristocratic women he found there could be trusted to remain discreet — even decades later.</p><p>He courted Lady Jane Grosvenor, daughter of the Duke of Westminster, and Lady Camilla Fane, daughter of the Earl of Westmorland.</p><p>Then there was the Duke of Grafton’s daughter, Lady Henrietta Fitzroy, whose mother was <a href=#>the Queen’s</a> mistress of the robes, along with Lady Angela Nevill, whose father was private secretary to <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>, and <a href=#>Lady Sarah Spencer</a>, the older sister of his future wife <a href=#>Diana</a>.</p><p>The beauties he romanced were dubbed “Charlie’s Angels” by the Press.</p><p>They included Fiona Cottrell, a former glamour model who had posed in Penthouse several years earlier.</p><p>The Prince would woo them with endless nocturnal telephone calls.</p><p>Yet the restrictions of palace life must have weighed heavily on their minds.</p><p>Beautiful and well-bred Lady Davina Sheffield, the granddaughter of ICI magnate Lord McGowan, dated <a href=#>Charles</a> in the mid-1970s.</p><p>But it emerged she had shared a cottage with an ex-boyfriend, unforgivable in a potential Princess of Wales in those days.</p><p>As

<a href=#>Charles</a> proposed to one of his Charlie’s Angels.</p><p>She was Amanda Knatchbull, daughter of Lord and Lady Brabourne, and granddaughter of his beloved mentor <a href=#>Earl Mountbatten</a>.</p><p>Charles had known Amanda since her childhood.</p><p>On meeting her again on holiday in 1973 when she was 15, he wrote to Mountbatten saying: “I must say, Amanda really has grown into a very good-looking girl — most disturbing.”</p><p>There were no romantic overtones until Amanda was 17 but her parents thought she was still too young for the glare of publicity.</p><p>They decided against Mountbatten’s suggestion that Amanda accompany Charles on an official 1980 trip to <a href=#>India</a>.</p><p>Months later, when Amanda was 21 Charles popped the question.</p><p>“What a funny idea,” she said, and politely declined.</p><p>Perhaps Charles’s inability to find a bride was also due to his own reticence.</p><p>For he had already met the woman who was the love of his life, but circumstance had kept them apart.</p><p>His first girlfriend, Lucia Santa Cruz, had been the matchmaker.</p><p>On a warm summer’s day in June 1971 she bounded up to Charles at a <a href=#>Windsor</a> polo match and insisted she had found “just the girl” for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

debutante.</p><p>Her relationship with Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles had ended in 1970 and he was courting Charles’s sister <a href=#>Princess Anne</a>.</p><p>Soon <a href=#>Charles and Camilla</a> were an item, meeting at polo matches and exclusive club <a href=#>Annabel’s</a> in London’s Berkeley Square.</p><p>The relationship was clearly serious. Charles met Camilla’s family and she met some of his.</p><p>Then things were put on hold in early 1973 when Charles was posted overseas with the Royal Navy.</p><p>Later that year their relationship was over.</p><p><a href=#>Camilla</a> announced her engagement to Andrew Parker Bowles.</p><p>Charles wrote to <a href=#>Lord Mountbatten</a> saying: “I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.”</p><p><a href=#>Charles</a> and Camilla remained friends, and when Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979 she provided comfort and solace.</p><p>The pair became lovers once more.</p><p>However, her past meant that under protocol at the time she could never be his wife.</p><p>So Charles’s search for a bride continued apace.</p><p>By 1980 he was dating Anna Wallace, 25, known to her friends as Whiplash.</p><p>But after almost a year they had a furious row at a ball in honour of the <a href=#>Queen Mother’s</a> 80th birthday.</p><p>While Charles mingled with guests, Anna felt she was being ignored.</p><p>She was overheard shouting at him: “I’ve never been so badly treated before in my life. No one treats me like that, not even you.”</p><p>Another relationship had perished.</p><p>In July 1980, Charles was invited to stay at the Sussex house of Philip de Pass.</p><p>Also in attendance was Lady Diana Spencer.</p><p><a href=#>Diana</a> would later say in tapes given to author Andrew Morton: “The first night we sat down on a bale at the barbecue at this house and he’d just finished with Anna Wallace.</p><p>“I said, ‘You looked so sad when you walked up the aisle at Lord Mountbatten’s funeral.
