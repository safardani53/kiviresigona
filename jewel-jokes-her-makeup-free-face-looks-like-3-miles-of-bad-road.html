I did not have one little teeny drop of alcohol. Nothing. And I look like three miles of bad road. Why? My face always goes on strike in Las Vegas. I don’t know. I walk through the casinos and my eyes burn. It must be all the sin in the air,” she joked.</p><p>Jewel went on to say that despite all of the traveling she does in her everyday life, she “sucks” at packing. “Somehow in my whole bag of toiletries, I don’t even have facial cleanser. I’m 49 years old. How do I not pack cleanser?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jewel-Jokes-Her-Makeup-Free-Face-Looks-Like-3-Miles-of-Bad-Road4.jpg><p>The “Foolish Games” singer explained that traveled to Vegas to see U2 perform at the Sphere. She shared that she’s also excited to see that the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) is also in town.</p><p>“Ya’ll, I’m staying at this hotel and there are so many cowboys. I love seeing it,” she said, inserting a short video clip of a group of men wearing cowboy hats in what appears to be her hotel lobby.</p><p>“It’s like the ghost of Christmas past […] I spent decades of my life at the NFR. It’s a trip to be here. It brings back so many memories.”</p><p>She ended the video giving a thoughtful shout out to her fans.</p><p>“Anyway, I hope y’all are having a good day. I hope you guys are eating. I hope y’all are taking care of yourselves – are y’all taking care of yourselves? It’s the holidays. It can be hard,” she said, adding, “I know people are with their families and that can be really triggering and hard. Some people don’t have any families and that’s triggering and hard. Just know I love you. Y’all got this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jewel-Jokes-Her-Makeup-Free-Face-Looks-Like-3-Miles-of-Bad-Road3.jpg><p>Jewel captioned the video: “When you wake up and your face looks like 3 miles of bad road .. 🤷‍♀️ 🤦‍♀️ plus the #rodeo is in town.”</p><p>Fans flocked to the comments to show their support for the singer. One wrote, “You can never look bad, you’re beautiful. I think sometimes we just wake up looking tired from everything that we are dealing with as humans.”</p><p>Another commented, “Please make the 3 miles of bad road a sound 😆🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽.”</p><p>Jewel recently made headlines when she was photographed <a href=#>getting close to<strong> Kevin Costner</strong></a> on vacation in the Caribbean.
