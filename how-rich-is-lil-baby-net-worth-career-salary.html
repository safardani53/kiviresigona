Morman also alluded to songs from the rapper’s recent album, It’s Only Me, in which he mocks the inaccurate information. According to the lyrics,</p><p>“Google claims I have a net worth of $5 million, but I obtained that in cash.”</p><p>Lil Baby indicated that he was unaware of the inaccurate information until his kid brought it to his attention. When he talked with his son, he learned that one of his son’s classmates had examined his father’s earnings, which were listed as $5 million. Morman questioned Baby whether he was above that number, to which he answered, “Right.”&nbsp;The Grammy winner also said that no one on Google’s net worth is precise or accurate. He said that he aspires to the prominence that a few rappers have acquired so far. He continued,</p><p>“Billionaire is the upper limit for everyone in the world right now.” So, if they start becoming trillionaires by the time I’m trying to become a billion, I’m sure I’ll want to start being a trillionaire. “I’m going for broke.”</p><p></p><h2>Lil Baby’s net worth</h2><p>Lil Baby rose to prominence with the release of his 2017 mixtape Perfect Timing. He also released three additional mixtapes that year: Harder Than Hard, The Hard Way, and Too Hard. Baby’s first album, Harder Than Ever, was released the following year, and the album’s hits, including Yes Indeed, reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100. The 27-year-old’s net worth is estimated to be approximately $8 million by CelebrityNetWorth as of December 2023. Although precise information about his assets is not accessible, his great career as a rapper has earned him a lot of money.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lil-Baby.jpg alt="Lil Baby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Lil Baby Collab & Other Work</h2><p>In October 2018, Lil Baby partnered with Gunna and released the mixtape, Drip Harder.
