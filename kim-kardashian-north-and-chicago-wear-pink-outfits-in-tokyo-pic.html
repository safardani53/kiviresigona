In one of the snaps, Kim is seen rocking a massive pink fur coat as her mini-mes matched in rosy ensembles. The Selfish author teamed her fuzzy outerwear piece with gray sweatpants, Air Jordans and a coordinating handbag. She completed the getup with metallic sunglasses.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Also in the social media carousel, the TV personality included a screenshot of a tweet that showed Khloé, 38, in a similar coat <a href=#>during a prior trip to Tokyo</a> with Kim and Kourtney, 43, which was documented on season 15 of <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. “Well well well @KimKardashian apologize now!!” the tweet read, prompting hilarious reactions from Khloé and Kourtney in the comments section.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’m waiting,” Khloé wrote via Instagram, as Kourtney added, “A long way from the cycling outfits.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As fans recall, Kim was very critical of her siblings for their outfit choices in Japan. “I can’t even eat dinner because I’m so disgusted with my sisters’ crazy outfits that completely don’t go with my look,” Kim said in a confessional during an October 2018 episode of the E! series. “Like, I can’t take it … My sisters look so crazy. It’s actually embarrassing.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Along with her fur coat, the Revenge Body alum donned a silver sequin dress, turquoise eyeshadow and costume jewelry. The Poosh founder, for her part, stepped out in a series of Japanese-inspired garbs that Kim said “looked really bad.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kim eventually brought her concerns to her sisters, telling them that they looked like “clowns.” She continued: “I’m not kidding. This is not, like, a tourist thing where it’s Halloween, [don’t] dress up like a f—king geisha unless we’re at a geisha house. I just think you’ve got to, like, chill. Like, you can be cooler. I’m not telling you guys what to be and what to wear or anything, but I’m telling you how to be and what to wear. It could be time for a fashion overhaul, so that you stay young and relevant.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Kardashians stars traveled to Tokyo at the time so that Kim could shoot a campaign for then-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>‘s <a href=#>Yeezy</a> clothing line.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“It’s my husband’s collection and I want to make sure that I do a good job and that he likes how everything turns out,” Kim said.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kim <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Kanye in February 2021, and Us Weekly confirmed in November 2022 that the former pair reached a settlement. Along with North and Chicago, the exes also share sons Saint, 7, and Psalm, 3.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jKemq6yYYq6vsIycn6KbkZy8bsPEmqlmqJmjuG671K2doqyjYravedOoorKnXaW2pHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-hume-xg6a-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>kyle Hume (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jorge-serratos-eopg-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jorge Serratos (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
