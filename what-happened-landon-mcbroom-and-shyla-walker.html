I ran back as fast as I could to Joe and I gave a description of what he was wearing," she said in the video.</p><p>"Landon had gone inside the house and I ran inside to find him and see what he was wearing. The dispatcher then told me that if there was no custody agreement or emergency protection on the child, they [police] couldn’t come.”</p><p>“And my heart dropped. I had taken off the speaker by that point so it was only me who had heard the dispatcher say that. Trying to think as quickly as I could I acted like I was still on the phone and I said “Joe if you just bring her back I’ll tell them not to come and I’ll hang up right now.” Landon then said “Ok Joe, bring her back and like I thank God that worked.”</p><h2>What did Landon say about Shyla's video?</h2><p>One month after Shyla's video, Landon then posted his own video titled, "<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The REAL Truth</a>," on October 6, claiming that Shyla lied about her allegations and he never tried to kidnap his daughter, he also gave context to the final meeting between the two.</p><p>“During this meeting I did not have any restraining order at all. This is also the last time that her and I ever spoke," Landon said.</p><p>"And not only that, this is less than a week, days after we supposedly kidnapped Souline. May 15 is when the kidnapping happened between Joseph and I and Souline. May 21, literally less than a week later is when we have this meeting in our home.”</p><p>Landon also went on to claim that there is actual footage of this final meeting and thanked his friend Joseph for recording it.</p><p>He continued: “Thankfully at this time, the only reason we had this footage was because Joseph was scared and was filming to protect himself. Mind you, this is days after he has been alleged as a kidnapper.”</p><p>At the end, Landon warned Shyla not to respond to the video or he would release more footage from the meeting, claiming that it would make her look really bad.</p><p>"I did not show the worst worst worst parts of the meeting footage," Landon said. "The reason why I'm not going to show you guys the rest of this meeting footage is because what you are going to see that she did and said, you are never going to be able to forgive her for...ever."</p><p>He continued: "If she responds to this video with more lies, more playing the victim, I will have no choice but to show you guys the footage."</p><p>At this time, Shyla has not commented on the recent video.</p><h2>Why did Shyla get a restraining order against Landon?</h2><p>On her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, Shyla justified seeking a restraining order following the alleged abuse, which according to the court documents, came after arguing over financial issues.</p><p>According to the documents, Landon had shoved Shyla "causing a laceration and visible injury to [her] finger."</p><p>The influencer also claimed that Landon had a history of abusing her prior to that incident, but Landon continues to claim the allegations are false.</p><p>She wrote on her story: "I've been beat, I've been abused, I've had three attempted kidnappings on my child. If you love someone you do not put yourself in the position to lose them. I will always do what's best for my child every single f***ing time."</p><p>However, she later revealed that she would be allowing Landon to maintain a relationship with Souline, despite previously seeking to keep him from his daughter.</p><p>Landon and Souline were recently reunited after three months apart.</p><p>"I requested visitation," Shyla said, "I want my daughter to have a relationship with her father who she will always love regardless of the circumstances."</p><p>She then slammed her ex for posting about his reunion with Souline, however, adding: "All I asked was for her privacy to be respected during this time not to extort her for clout and/or monetary gains."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/GettyImages-1093002862jpg-JS674905474.jpg><h2>What do Shyla and Landon do for a living?</h2><p>Prior to their breakup, the two ran a shared YouTube channel called THIS IS L&S, which had more than 3 million subscribers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Shyla and Landon have since deleted every video from the channel except for their farewell - THE END OF THIS IS L&S.</p><p>Outside of YouTube, Landon is pursuing a boxing career.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>TikTok star Austin McBroom slaps daughter’s butt in controversial videoAustin McBroom slap video</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZWh9c4GSaK6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdoa6vsM6nZKabkqe8sLmMmqWdZaOdxq2tjLCYpaOVp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kc-eusebios-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is KC Eusebio Dating KC Eusebio's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./enrique-iglesias-kids-4622367.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet His 3 Children with Anna Kournikova Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
