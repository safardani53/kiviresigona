Over the course of 12 seasons, viewers get to watch the cast live their lives with the swamp while we learn more than we ever thought we could about the Atchafalaya Basin in Louisiana. This is the largest wetland and swamp in the U.S. so there's so much swampland for the cast to explore.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Swamp People cast probably lives a much simpler life than a lot of its viewers, but that doesn't mean they don't get paid. One website says that all the cast together, past and present, have a salary of $6 million, although the amount the cast makes on the show varies widely, and not every cast member's salaries are public knowledge.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much do alligator hunters make on 'Swamp People'?</h2><p>Over the course of the show, stars have come and gone. During Season 12, there are 19 people on the cast, and the amount of money they make from it can vary widely. Troy Landry probably makes the most out of everyone else on the show. He's said to have a net worth of $2 million and makes $30,000 per month from the show. His son Jacob makes $40 per Swamp People episode. Other sources say that the cast of the show makes as little as $10,000 per episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Troy and Jacob are fan favorites on the show, so it makes sense that they might be paid more money than others. Glenn Guist reportedly had a net worth of $700,000 from the show. Terral Evans is reported to be a millionaire because of the show. Daniel Edgar has been on Swamp People since 2016, and he only makes about $10,000 from each episode, which is a very low number in comparison to other cast members. For some other members of the show like <a href=#>Willie Edwards</a>, it's unclear how much they've made.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Daniel's grandson <a href=#>Dorien Edgar</a> doesn't publicly have a salary available, but if his grandfather's number is any indication, he's not making much. Gerard “Gee” Singleton's salary also isn't available, but he reportedly has a net worth of $300,000. Zak Catchem stars on the show as well, but he also makes money as a YouTuber. He has two channels all about fishing and has over three million subscribers on his main channel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catch Em All Fishing</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much do regular alligator hunters make?</h2><p>Even though the cast of Swamp People is making a lot of money, not every alligator hunter is on TV. It's reported that they typically work on a freelance basis where they only get paid when they have an alligator to sell. How much an individual can make depends greatly. It's reported that some get paid up to $40 per foot of the reptile unprocessed.&nbsp;</p><p>People hunting alligators for sport in Louisiana need to have a license issued from the government. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Louisiana's state website</a>, a license costs $25 for state residents and $150 for non-residents. There are also registrations for boats, certifications, and other types of permits that all can come with some kind of fee.</p><p>Swamp People airs at 9 p.m. EST, Thursdays on History.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllKR6orjLop6arJ%2BneqnBza2cq6tdoq6ssQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-ray-j-sex-tape-drama-everything-theyve-said.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian, Ray J Sex Tape Drama: Everything They've Said</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dwayne-johnsons-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dwayne Johnsons Girlfriend: Who is Dwayne Johnson Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
