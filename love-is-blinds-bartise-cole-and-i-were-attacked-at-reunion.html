I just sat there. I was like, ‘You guys are right. Like, whatever you’re saying, I literally did. So, are you gonna beat a dead horse at this point or are we moving on?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Love-Is-Blind-Bartise-Bowden-Thinks-He-and-Cole-Barnett-Were-Both-Attacked-at-the-Reunion.jpg><p>The Texas native proposed to <a href=#><strong>Nancy Rodriguez</strong></a> during the pod phase of the reality dating show’s third season, which premiered in October. He and the speech pathologist, 33, had their ups and downs and Bartise ultimately said “no” on their wedding day.</p><p>“I think Nancy brought this up [during the reunion], I don’t know if they aired it, but she was like, ‘The difference between Bartise and Cole was [that] Bartise was brutally honest and kind of an asshole to your face,” the CPA told Us.</p><p>“Meanwhile, the girls had this thought that <a href=#>Cole was more deceitful and undermining</a> and so he was there defending himself. I was just there, like, ‘You guys are right, I’m owning up to it.’ So, they couldn’t attack me as aggressively because I don’t think I gave them opportunity to.”</p><p>On the show, Bartise didn’t shy away from admitting that he found another woman from the pods, <a href=#><strong>Raven Ross</strong></a>, physically attractive. While talking to Nancy during their Malibu getaway, he called Raven, 29, a “smoke show.” The University of Texas alum told Us that in hindsight, he isn’t proud of how he handled the situation.</p><p>“It was definitely hard and … embarrassing to watch. … I definitely feel bad about that,” he admitted.</p><p>Cole, 27, also didn’t hesitate to tell his then-fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Zanab Jaffrey</strong></a>, that another girl in the cast, <a href=#><strong>Colleen Reed</strong></a>, had caught his eye. After saying no on their wedding day, Zanab, 32, claimed that the realtor had ruined her self-esteem. During the reunion, she recalled a moment in which Cole commented on her decision to eat two Cuties, claiming the incident was <a href=#>an example of him trying to control her eating</a> habits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Love-Is-Blinds-Alexa-Alfia-Thinks-Zanab-Jaffrey-and-Cole-Barnett-Were-Both-to-Blame-for-Breakup-2.jpg><p>“I don’t think it looks bad for Cole at all,” Bartise told Us of the controversial Cuties scene, which Netflix aired at the end of the reunion. “Zanab is not the most secure woman as is, so, like, that is gonna be an issue for her.”</p><p>The reality TV personality had a <a href=#>somewhat controversial moment</a> of his own when he and Nancy discussed family planning.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was definitely worried because that’s such a politically polarizing topic,” Bartise told Us of the scene, adding that they addressed the issue head-on.</p><p>“We’re sitting there and there’s two huge cameras pointing at us <a href=#>and we’re talking about abortion</a> and it’s like, ‘OK, are we gonna actually get into this right now?’ … I’m proud of both of us for saying our opinions and not giving a care what these cameras are gonna be thinking or what the 80 million people that watched Love Is Blind are gonna be thinking,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYq%2BivtOiqp5lk6S5pnnAp5tmoV2ssrOxjJqrrZmToLKlecCtZKudpaO2sLqO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nina-dobrev-dress-met-gala-2019-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nina Dobrevs Dress At Met Gala 2019 Looks Like Metallic Tinker Bell Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emaciated-great-dane-rescued-from-iowa-apartment.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emaciated Great Dane Weighing 44 Pounds Rescued from Iowa Apartment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
