showers" that will move in from the east and bring "temperatures near zero", according to the <a href=#>Met Office</a>.</p><p>The forecaster added: "Given these wintry showers, and also wet surfaces after recent wet weather, some icy patches are likely on untreated surfaces.</p><p>"Additionally a few of the snow showers could turn quite heavy; these probably only affecting a narrow zone but a few places could see 1-3cm, mainly over the north Downs and on grassy surfaces."</p><p>It comes as <a href=#>amber alerts were launched</a> for about half of the country for most of next week which will likely see the <a href=#>number of deaths rise</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on UK News">Read more on UK News</h2><p>The warning, released by the <a href=#>Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency</a>, covers much of west and central England.</p><p>It will see <a href=#>temperatures drop to -6C</a> in one part of the country as <a href=#>widespread flooding and downpours continue</a>.</p><p>It is set to last for five days, between midday on January 7 and midday on January 12.</p><p>The four regions affected are the North West, West Midlands, East Midlands and the South West.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Those areas are likely to have an "observed increase in mortality across the population", particularly in those aged above 65 and with underlying health conditions.</p><p>Effects will also be felt as heating systems struggle to keep indoor areas at normal levels.</p><p>Staffing issues will occur, the warnings said, as travel delays and energy problems affect workers.</p><p>The Met Office said that there was also a chance the temperatures would drop to -6C in rural areas along the&nbsp;<a href=#>Welsh</a>&nbsp;border in&nbsp;<a href=#>Shropshire</a>&nbsp;and north&nbsp;<a href=#>Herefordshire</a>&nbsp;on Sunday night.</p><p>It comes as the Met Office said the mercury dipped to a chilly -4.3C in Shap,&nbsp;<a href=#>Cumbria</a>, on Saturday.</p><p>Meanwhile yellow alerts have been issued for the remaining areas in England.</p><p>That includes the North East, Yorkshire and The Humber, East of England, London and South East areas.</p><p>A yellow alert means there is the potential for significant impacts to be observed.</p><p>English regions are still trying to recover from flooding after&nbsp;<a href=#>Storm Henk claimed a second victim</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>There are currently 167 flood warnings where flooding is expected and 171 flood alerts where flooding is possible across the country, according to the Met Office's website.</p><p>Those areas are particularly along the Rivers Trent, Severn and Thames and will continue for the next four days.</p><p>"Properties will flood and there will be travel disruption," the Met Office said.</p><p>"River flooding impacts are also possible across parts of Yorkshire and Humber today, and possible but not expected tomorrow, as river levels remain high after the prolonged and recent wet weather."</p><p><a href=#>Prime Minister</a>&nbsp;Rishi Sunak said "flooding has been having a devastating impact on communities up and down the country"&nbsp;as he visited affected residents in Oxford.</p><p>"I was in the East Midlands last week on Thursday and I'm in Oxfordshire here today talking to some of those that have been affected, but also saying thank you to our first responders who were doing a fantastic job over the past week.</p><p>"We have over 1,000 Environment Agency personnel on the ground in local communities helping, over 200 pumps have been deployed."</p><p>Chief Met Office forecaster Jason Kelly said: "The transition to lower temperatures will be noticeable over the weekend.</p><p>"It will become rather cold next week with lower-than-average temperatures across much of the UK, accentuated by brisk easterly winds in the south.</p><p>"As the prevailing weather conditions will be characterised by high pressure, a good deal of settled weather is likely.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Clearer skies and a marked reduction in precipitation are expected, although any showers that do occur are likely to be wintry in nature.</p><p>"A combination of overnight freezing temperatures, saturated ground and calm winds mean increasing risks of frost, fog and icy conditions."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
