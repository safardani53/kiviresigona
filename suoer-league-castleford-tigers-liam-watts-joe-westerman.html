One lifts more than the other in the gym, the other claims they did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RLwattswesterman03-1-1.jpg><p>But the rowing brothers-in-law will bring more out of each other as the 2022 Super League season is more like child’s play.</p><p>That in turn will see the Tigers roar more loudly under new boss Lee Radford – almost as loudly as they roar at each other.</p><p>“It’s constant,” said prop Watts, who teased his relative about a new tracksuit top, asking whether it had been bought from a pre-worn retro shop.</p><p>“If I said today’s Friday, he’d swear it’s Saturday but it’s business as usual. It’s like he’s never been away.</p><p>“We lived in the same area as kids and went to the same school. We started here when we were 15 or 16-years-old – hopefully now, we can finish our careers where it all started.”</p><p>Loose forward Westerman added: “We’ve played rugby together since we were eight or nine-years-old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RLwattswesterman03-1-1.webp><p>“I just switch off to him now, so when I hear him, it’s just straight in one ear and out of the other.</p><p>“Even if Liam lifts more in the gym, I’d argue he doesn’t. It’s like the film Step Brothers now!”</p><p>Watts and Westerman were part of Castleford school Airedale’s mighty rugby team, which won almost all the national trophies.</p><p>They then played together at amateur side Lock Lane before both went through Castleford’s youth ranks and into the first team.</p><p>Westerman was seen as the bright new thing when he made his senior debut aged just 16 – but after 11 years away, a different version has returned.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby League</h2></p><p>A more worldly-wise player, who knows what it takes to keep in peak condition – the days of unhealthy eating and drinking are long gone.</p><p>Now after a spell together at Hull FC in 2015, they are ready to do it together for their hometown club, which certainly means more.</p><p>Westerman, 32, added: “I wish I knew then what I know now. I find it a little easier now I’m older as I know more about the game – when I was younger, I just winged it.</p><p>“I just relied on being skilful rather than knowing what to work hard away from the gym, like things in the gym.</p><p>“Now it’s about making sure I stay strong, then when we’re playing I take things a bit easier and not be as erratic as I was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RLwattswesterman03-2-1.jpg><p>“It was pretty much a case of, ‘Where do I sign?’ I always said I wanted to come back here but I’ve got a few good years left in me.</p><p>“When I got the opportunity, it was a case of, ‘Let me get in and get going.’”</p><p>And Watts, the 31-year-old who is married to Westerman’s sister Beth, conceded: “He’s our ball handling loose forward, so it’s been nice to have someone in the team everyone can run off.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“That will definitely help us this year and take a bit of pressure off me, allowing me to do other things. Being together will definitely bring more out of ourselves as players.</p><p>“Joe could’ve gone elsewhere but when he said he had the opportunity, it made most sense to come here.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH54gpFvbG1tX6jCsLHRZqOemZeqsm6vwKyrpZ2WpL%2BledOinp6qo2K5qq3MZq6arKSoequ7xGaunqukmr%2Burc1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angelina-jolie-oversized-square-sunglasses-nyc-street-style-amazon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Channel Angelina Jolies Shades With These $14 Sunglasses</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kidd-kidd-19911126-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kidd Kidd (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
