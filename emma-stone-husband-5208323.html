Dave is a segment director for the beloved comedy sketch show. There had been rumors that he’d directed the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Wells for Boys”</a> skit, and that’s when the two of them really hit it off. A few months later the pair were seen on a date, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>director proposed</a> to Emma in December 2019. The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> pair got married</a> in September 2020, after three years together. Shortly before tying the knot, the pair also launched their own production company, Fruit Tree.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Since the pair first started dating, they’ve mostly kept their relationship<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> very private,</a> but they have been spotted on a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> few dates together</a> over the years. Nearly one year after getting married, the pair welcomed their first child together in March 2021. Emma <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a baby girl,</a> a few months after her pregnancy was revealed.</p><h2>Teddy Geiger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/emma-stone-husband-embed-teddy-geiger.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>One of Emma’s first public relationships was with musician<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Teddy Geiger,</strong></a> who she started seeing in 2017 per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. She starred alongside the “For You I Will” singer-songwriter in the 2008 musical comedy The Rocker. The pair split up in 2009.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Teddy acted in the movie alongside Emma, she’s primarily a musician and songwriter, who has written for major artists like <strong>Shawn Mendes, Niall Horan,</strong> One Direction, and many more. Teddy came out as a trans-woman in October 2017.</p><h2>Kieran Culkin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/emma-stone-husband-embed-kieran-culkin.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Emma met future&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kieran Culkin</a>&nbsp;</strong>while they were making the 2009 flick&nbsp;Paper Man.&nbsp;In the movie, they played a couple, and some of the on-screen chemistry clearly carried offscreen. The pair split up in 2011, but they seemed to remain on good terms. They both appeared in the “Veronica” segment of the star-studded 2013 flop Movie 43.&nbsp;In 2022, the pair also posed for a photo together at the Met Gala, over a decade after they split. Kieran wrapped his arm around his ex for a sweet moment on the red carpet.</p><h2>Andrew Garfield</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/emma-stone-husband-embed-andrew-garfield.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>After her split from Kieran, Emma connected with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Andrew Garfield</a>&nbsp;</strong>while they were filming&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man&nbsp;in 2011. Andrew played the web-slinging Peter Parker and Emma played the love interest Gwen Stacy. They reprised their roles in the 2014 sequel. At that time, Andrew also hosted&nbsp;SNL,&nbsp;and Emma made a surprise appearance during his monologue. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The pair</a> made quite a few public appearances together during their relationship, which ended in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Despite their breakup, they both appeared to be very supportive of one another. Emma called&nbsp;The Social Network&nbsp;star “someone I still love very much” in a 2016&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>&nbsp;interview. Andrew named the actress as the one person he’d want to be stuck on a desert island with in a 2016 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter.</a>&nbsp;“She’s all right. She can come,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Even though there were occasional r<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eunion rumors</a> and the pair continued to support one another, they never formally got back together. Andrew did reveal that they were still relatively close while promoting his appearance in&nbsp;Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2022. He said that Emma had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pressed about him making a surprise appearance</a> in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Happy Sad Confused&nbsp;</a>podcast interview. “Emma kept on texting me. She was like, ‘are you in this new&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;film?’” he said. “And I was like, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8SmpJplo6m8r7GMoaysmpGjsW6BkWlvbGpjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dax-shepard-nude-pic-hard-soft-kristen-bell-handstand.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dax Shepard posts NUDE pic of 'hard and soft' Kristen Bell &amp;amp; calls her 'uber talented' as she attemp</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-challenge-winner-kaycee-details-relationship-future-with-nany.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Challenge' Winner Kaycee Details Relationship, Future With Nany</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
