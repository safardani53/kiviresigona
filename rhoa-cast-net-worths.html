With the women serving at the helm of beauty brands, fashion endeavors, adult entertainment businesses, and more, the peach holders know a thing or two about keeping the coins rolling in. And after Season 14 and Season 15 welcomed new blood into the mix, fans grew eager to learn more about the ladies.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Season 14 featured Olympic gold-medalist <a href=#>Sanya Richards-Ross</a> and welcomed the return of <a href=#>Shereé Whitfield</a>. The two ladies also returned for <a href=#>Season 15</a>. Kenya Moore, Kandi Burruss, <a href=#>Drew Sidora</a>, and the always fashionable Marlo Hampton are also the focus the current season. And since the ladies continue to make incredible strides in their careers — aside from RHOA — it’s only right we highlight their finances.</p><p>We're uncovering the RHOA cast members' net worth and the shocking truth about their pay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.

To clarify, the cast did get paid, but it wasn't much. According to NeNe, she only collected $10,000 for Season 1, which took three months to film. By the time Season 2 had rolled around, NeNe says her salary was only bumped up to $50,000.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fed up with the low pay compared to the high viewer ratings, NeNe says she and other cast members joined forced and demanded more money.
