She is a YouTuber and Twitch streamer often criticized for her appearance.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On February 18, 2022, she received a Twitch ban, which divided the internet. It was reported that the ban was because of the nip slip she had while she was streaming.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Many believed she was flashing, while the other half thought it was merely a wardrobe malfunction. Finally, Cooney took to YouTube to explain what happened with her and the Twitch ban. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Eugenia Cooney's Twitch Ban Because of Nip Slip</h2><p>This was the first time Cooney was&nbsp;temporarily banned from&nbsp;Twitch. Initially, many thought the ban was placed because of her <a href=# rel=follow>glorifying eating disorders</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She has admitted to having eating disorders, but she has also claimed that she never glorifies it.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Regardless, many petitions have been signed&nbsp;to&nbsp;deplatform Cooney and get her banned from social media platforms like YouTube and Twitch.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So when Cooney received&nbsp;her first ban, fans presumed it was because of all the petitions. But later, it was confirmed that the Twitch ban was because of her nip slip or unintentional flashing.&nbsp;</p><p>After she was banned, a drama commentator, Rich Lux, reached out to Cooney and asked her about the situation. Via DMs, she confirmed she was banned temporarily for a day because of a nip slip.</p><p>It was because a fan asked to see her makeup closely while she was live on stream. So, while she leaned forward, she had a wardrobe malfunction, and her strapless dress slipped. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a result, she accidentally and unintentionally flashed to her fans on the platform and hence got banned. Moreover, the clip of her wardrobe malfunction was reported and taken out of context.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, Twitch did not confirm the reason for the ban. Cooney was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unbanned</a> from the platform after a day,&nbsp;seven&nbsp;minutes and 28 seconds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Eugenia Cooney's Explanation for Flashing&nbsp;</h2><p>On February 20, 2022, Cooney <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a video</a> on her YouTube channel titled 'I Got BANNED...I'm Sorry.' There, she said the same thing as she told Lux. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She understood why she received a one-day Twitch ban and apologized for it. However, she claimed the nip slip was not intentional, and once she realized it, she stopped the stream.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But the damage had been done. The clip of her&nbsp;accidental flashing was reposted on different channels, and Cooney took one of the clips down from YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Eugenia Cooney posing for a picture.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She clarified she did so because she was not comfortable with her wardrobe malfunction being publicized in such a negative sense.&nbsp;It was taken out of context, so she took the clip down to protect herself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After she got banned, many claimed that this was not Cooney's first wardrobe malfunction. She had allegedly flashed before, but the streamer claimed she had no reason to stream her nip slip.</p><p>She reiterated she had done nothing on purpose and everything was purely accidental. She confirmed she loved the platform and her followers too much to risk her career on it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also squashed all rumors of her having secret deals for flashing on stream. In the end, she apologized to Twitch and her followers and thanked them for supporting her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2lnLKvtcBmmqinnprGbrrIqWSspJmlerXDyK2aoWaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./guillermo-maldonado.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Guillermo Maldonado</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carter-smith-20050808-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carter Smith (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
