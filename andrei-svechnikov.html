He was born to father Igor Svechnikov and mother Elena Svechnikov. He has an elder brother: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evgeny Svechnikov</a>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-Svechnikov-Brothers.jpg><p><span>The Svechnikov family shifted to Barnaul Russia after 1995. They did so because of the massive 1995 Neftegorsk earthquake.</span></p><p><span>Andrei is not the only ice hockey enthusiast in the family. His elder brother, Evgeny, is equally popular in the NHL. Andrei basically followed the footsteps of his elder brother.</span></p><p>You might be interested in reading:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Curtis McElhinney: Ice Hockey, NHL, Family & Net Worth</a></strong></p><h3><span>Mother’s Love</span></h3><p><span>The Svechnikov boys receive the utmost support from their parents. Their mother, Elena, has stood firm and flexible at the same time for her sons.</span></p><p><span>Their father, Igor, is the only family member living in Russia as of now. He could not leave the country because of his work.</span></p><p><span>Elene transitioned to the United States so that her sons could flourish in their careers without having to stay away from home. She could only speak a few English words.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nothing beats the love of a mother. She holds that strength to sacrifice her social relationships and shift to an alien’s land where she cannot even communicate with the people around her.</span></p><p><span>Elena never misses her sons’ tournaments. She believes that her presence motivates and provides moral support to both of her sons.</span></p><p><span>Andrei is very close to his family, and particularly his mother. His favorite way to pass his spare time is to watch good movies and enjoy his mother’s cooking. Elena once said in an interview that Andrei loves pasta, chicken, and borscht cooked by her.</span></p><p><span>She further said that her younger one is a clean freak. He has to have his room neat and tidy every time. She further added that Andrei gets pissed off if he does not find his things in the right place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Elena describes Andrei as a very kind human being. She said that both her boys are very responsible. She further added that there are instances where she learned kindness and responsiveness from her sons.</span></p><p>You might also be interested in reading:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deryk Engelland Bio: Ice hockey, NHL, Family, & Wiki</a></strong></p><h3><span>More about Andrei</span></h3><p><span>Andrei admitted that he is superstitious when it comes to his tournaments. But he did not describe his superstition particularly because he believed that once he says it openly, it would stop working for him.</span></p><p><span>He further said that he likes having pasta and chicken as a pregame meal. As for pets, Andrei loves kittens and can be often seen playing with them.</span></p><h3><span>Evgeny Svechnikov: The Elder Brother</span></h3><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evgeny</a> is four years older than Andrei. The Detroit Red Wings drafted him in the 2015 NHL draft, 19</span><span>th</span><span> overall. He played his debut game with them in the 2015-2016 seasons.</span></p><p><span>Detroit Red Wings then assigned him their AHL affiliate Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) on April 24, 2016.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evgeny</a> and Andrei were almost certain to play against each other in 2019. However, the awaited game did not occur because the Detroit Red Wings sent Evgeny to their AHL affiliate for an emergency right before the team faced the Carolina Hurricanes.</span></p><p><span>The fans and well-wishers of the Svechnikov brothers want to see them face each other in a legit tournament. The boys grew up together and practiced the sport together for the longest time.</span></p><p><span>If the match happens, it would be fascinating to watch.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evgeny Svechnikov Bio: Ice Hockey Career, Net Worth & Wiki>></a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-Svechnikov-Family.jpg><h2><span>Andrei Svechnikov – Ice Hockey Career</span></h2><p><span>Andrei first played professional ice hockey as a junior in North America with the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the United States Hockey League (USHL).</span></p><p><span>He signed a tender with the Muskegon Lumberjacks in May 2016. He must have taken this route because the family already had to go for a reallocation. His brother, Evgeny, played for the Grand Rapid Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) then.</span></p><p><span>Andrei recorded some good scores and finished sixth overall in the 2016-2017 seasons of the league. He was also named to the All-USHL Team. He was then declared USHL Rookie of the Year.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon Carlo Bio: Ice Hockey Career, NHL, Family, Net Worth, & Wiki>></a></strong></p><h3><span>Canadian Hockey League (CHL)</span></h3><p><span>Andrei Svechnikov was drafted in the 2019 CHL Import Draft, first overall.

It was an assist in a 3–1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, he recorded his career-first NHL goal during an 8–5 win against the New York Rangers on October 7.</span></p><p><span>As a result, he enlisted himself as the first player born in the 2000s to have scored an NHL goal.</span></p><p><span>He completed his rookie season with 20 goals and 17 assists for 37 points. Further, he recorded 5 points in 9 postseason games.</span></p><p><span>Andrei stood up as the first NHL player to score a “Michigan” goal on October 29, 2019. He recorded it against David Rittich in a 2–1 victory over the Calgary Flames.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, he recorded a similar goal on December 17 against the Winnipeg Jets.</span></p><p><span>Andrei has been getting better and more polished every other day.
