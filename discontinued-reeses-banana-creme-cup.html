We’re glad to hear it was a fan favorite, and we’ll be sure to add your vote for its return!”</p><p>Despite this message, there’s been no further indication that the Peanut Butter & Banana Creme Cup will be returning to stores at any specific time.</p><h2>OTHER DISCONTINUED CANDY</h2><p>Other candy makers have also been feeling the heat from shoppers after discontinuing fan-favorite treats.</p><p>For example, <a href=#>Hershey’s S’mores bar</a> was legendary to all who knew it.</p><p>It debuted in 2003 and found great success before disappearing from stores altogether.</p><p>The dessert bar featured a delicious layer of marshmallow cream sitting atop a graham cracker crust that was drenched in chocolate.</p><p><a href=#>Hershey’s Kissables</a> also drew noteworthy attention when they launched several years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Each Hershey Kiss was coated in colorful, crunchy sugar shells, giving them an M&M look with the Hershey chocolate inside.</p><p>In 2021, Hershey fans started a <a href=#>Change.org</a> petition to try and get Kissables back in stores.</p><p>It gained thousands of signatures as shoppers shared their fondest memories with the Kissables.</p><p>"They remind me of when things were better and happier and I want a piece of that," wrote one person.</p><p>Another discontinued sweet treat is the <a href=#>pistachio-flavored Oreo Thins.</a></p><p>Oreo confirmed the cookies were unavailable in 2020 after shoppers said they were “impossible to find" on store shelves.</p><p>Many shoppers called out the cookie brand in hopes it would reintroduce the snack in stores.</p><p><a href=#>Twitter </a>user Paul Kingsley said: “Please bring back pistachio Oreo thins. They disappeared with the <a href=#>pandemic</a>.
