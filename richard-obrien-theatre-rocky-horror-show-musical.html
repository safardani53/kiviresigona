I just happen to be more towards the middle than most.”</p><p>He considers himself to be 70 per cent male — but his wife reckons that it is more like 50-50.</p><p>Richard adds: “I was working with the actor Anton Rodgers and he said, ‘I think you are the <a href=#>third sex’</a> and I thought that’s quite a nice ­position to be.”</p><p>Born in <a href=#>Cheltenham</a> and brought up in <a href=#>New Zealand</a> from the age of ten, Richard always knew he was ­different.</p><p>He recalls: “I grew up in New ­Zealand in a rural farming ­community, where blokes are blokes. It wouldn’t have been easy if you were too ‘out there’.”</p><p>His dad Alec was an accountant while Richard’s interest was in the arts rather than maths.</p><p>He left school aged 15 and tried various jobs, including farmer, ­hairdresser and glazier.</p><p>Seven years later, in 1964, he moved back to England, where he used his horse-riding skills to work as a stuntman in movies including Carry On Cowboy before training to be an actor.</p><p>It was the shock of being ditched from the role of King Herod in Jesus Christ Superstar after just a couple of rehearsals that riled ­Richard enough for him to decide to write his own musical.</p><p>He says: “It was the best thing that could have happened to me, because if that hadn’t I wouldn’t have written Rocky.</p><p>“I’m not saying I wrote it out of spite, but something close to it.”</p><p>The £300 pay-off he received from Superstar allowed him the time to expand on some songs he had already written.</p><p>At the time, the glam rock scene had taken off in Britain, with bands such as T.Rex and Slade enjoying huge hits, so there was an appetite for excess ­glitter.</p><p>Richard’s mash-up of wacky horror, science-fiction and comedy was unlike anything anyone had seen before.</p><p>He recalls: “I was a high-school drop-out, I was severely under- educated, and I was a chap who loved comics and B-movies and rock ’n’ roll and juvenile teenage elements, Rocky is full of that.”</p><p>Richard, who married his first wife Kimi Wong in 1971 and became a father to eldest son Linus a year later, was still trying to figure out who he really was.</p><p>The riotous tale of two high-school sweethearts both sleeping with a “sweet transvestite” was ahead of its time, considering that homosexuality had only been decriminalised in ­Britain six years earlier.</p><p>It was a chance for Richard to express his true self on stage — because it was too dangerous to do so on <a href=#>London’s</a> streets.</p><p>He says: “I lived in my head. When you were transgender or gay in those days, you weren’t going to flaunt yourself around too much — your own safety depended on blending in and minding your manners.”</p><p>But he wanted to make sure the audience had fun.</p><p>The writer explains: “I hate theatre that beats you over the head with a message and is pleased with itself and sanctimonious and earnest — I hate it. When you go to the theatre you go to escape your troubles of the day, to forget them and be ­transported to another world on an enjoyable ­journey.”</p><p>Jim Sharman, who had directed ­Richard in the hippie musical Hair, liked the script enough to bring it to the Royal Court Theatre on Sloane Square in West London.</p><p>It’s a bed-hopping farce where the corset- wearing Dr Frank-N-Furter seduces young lovers Brad and Janet after they end up at his spooky ­castle.</p><p>In the original shows, Richard played the butler Riff Raff, who does the Time Warp to take his fellow aliens back to their home planet.</p><h2>‘Ballet tights’</h2><p>On opening night in June 1973, Witchfinder General movie star Vincent Price sat in the front row and it was an “instant hit”.</p><p>Richard says: “I was amazed after six months we were still running. When seven years passed I was even more amazed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darcy-finden-columbia-811590048.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trangender-fans-walk-red-carpet-812126509.jpg><p>“I don’t quite understand what makes it so popular, but this is a show that appeals to the ordinary man and woman in the street.”</p><p>Richard went on to star in several movies, including Flash Gordon, Dungeons & Dragons and Spice World.</p><p>Hosting The Crystal Maze in a long fur coat for three years from 1990 was his most ­memorable TV role.</p><p>Remarkably, though, it took two decades from making Rocky Horror for Richard to publicly “come out” as trans.</p><p>And even then his mum Mary could not believe he was anything other than a regular bloke.</p><p>Richard laughs: “My siblings and my mother said, ‘What are you ­talking about? He’s not at all.’</p><p>“I said, ‘Have you seen pictures of me at barbecues, my brother Rob’s place, wearing make-up and earrings and ballet tights and a ballet wrap and cowboy boots?</p><p>“‘I think I was giving you a few clues, wasn’t I?’”</p><p>Even after having a son, Joshua, now 39, and daughter, Amelia, 33, with second wife Jane Moss, who he divorced in 2006, he was still ­confused about his identity.</p><p>“You live inside your head and that isn’t healthy,” he says.</p><p>In his fifties, Richard had a breakdown before realising it was the love of his family that truly counted.</p><p>He says: “At some stage I said, ‘F*** it, I am who I am’ and that was a strange thing.”</p><p>Richard, who married Sabrina in 2013, continues: “I don’t give a ­monkey’s — my wife loves me, my children love me, my friends love me and I am quite open.”</p><p>In 2020 he suffered a stroke at his home near Katikati in New Zealand.</p><p>Thankfully, it was a minor one and he has recovered sufficiently to work on a satirical fairytale called ­Kingdom Of Bling.</p><p>Richard says: “I am well but I wouldn’t recommend old age. The worst bit is I get arthritis in my thumbs.”</p><p>One thing audiences attending the Rocky Horror shows through the UK this year won’t have to worry about is being arrested for singing along.</p><p>Earlier this month<a href=#> police removed audience members from The ­Bodyguard musical in Manchester </a>for disrupting the performance.</p><p>But an interactive element has long been a key to The Rocky Horror Show’s success.</p><p>During one performance, when Richard’s character went to shoot Frank, David Bowie’s then-wife Angie was in the audience and she shouted out: “Don’t do it!”</p><p>These days the audience plays along with the cast, calling out and singing at key points.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Richard concludes: “People say Rocky is coming to town — let’s have a party.”</p><ul><li><strong>The Rocky Horror Show tours the UK until October 2023.
