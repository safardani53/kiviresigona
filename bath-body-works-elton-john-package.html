As she tracked the package, it was in the wrong state, rerouted, and finally delivered, she shared on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But when it was delivered, she was faced with a major surprise. Instead of all of her Bath & Body Works goods, the package was filled with <a href=#>Elton John</a> CDs. It’s not only super random and hilarious, but also confusing! What could have possibly happened?!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Keke shared on TikTok how her Bath & Body Works package showed up full of Elton John CDs.</h2><p>We always expect package mishaps, but not to the level that Keke dealt with. “So I ordered a bunch of stuff from Bath & Body Works on Black Friday,” Keke shared. “And it took a while for it to ship and when it did ship, I was watching it everyday. Because I love watching package-traveling TV.</p><p>“But I saw that it went to a different state for delivery, not the state that I live in. And I was a little confused, but then it said it was rerouted back to the post office in the city where I live. But then, my boyfriend stopped at the post office and asked where it was and they said, ‘We don’t know, everything is lost.’”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Even without the Elton John piece of the puzzle, this package has gone on quite the journey. Is anyone else clamoring for a Pixar movie following the life of Keke’s package? It could be called Keke’s Delivery in a nod to Miyazaki’s Kiki’s Delivery Service. It’s like a sequel, but has nothing to do with the original film!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But the story continues, and here’s where it gets weird. “Well, it showed up,” Keke said. “But it’s just Elton John CDs! It’s all Elton John! I love Elton John but I just want my home fragrances,” Keke laugh-cries along with her boyfriend.</p><p>We’re left wondering... Is this a comedy? A mystery? A tragedy? There are so many emotions and yet, confusion trumps all.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">People want to know how Keke’s package ended up with Elton John CDs.</h2><p>We all have a lot of questions, like how Keke’s package ended up in a different state first and why it was delivered with Elton John CDs? Luckily, Keke informed Bath & Body Works immediately of the situation when the package was lost, so they sent a replacement. She also filed a complaint with USPS because her package was tampered with, which is illegal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But people in the comments have their own anecdotes about delivery service workers tampering with packages. They are the ones with the access, after all. Many comments about FedEx report receiving empty boxes or seeing the truck on their driveway, seeing the package marked “delivered,” but not getting anything.</p><p>Of course, part of the problem may be that delivery services should probably pay their workers more and maybe they wouldn’t be tempted to tamper with and intercept packages. On the other hand, Keke now has a full box of Elton John CDs and her Bath & Body Works order!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But the biggest question that may never be answered is who could possibly have that many Elton John CDs and why did they decide to pay them forward to an unsuspecting package receiver? Keke’s order transformed from fragrances to Bath and Body and Bennie and the Jets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl661tIybpp2xXay8s7fSZpylrJ%2Bjequ7x6dkqZmToK6osQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alan-thicke-19470301-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alan Thicke (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-ilasi-wiki-age-net-worth-girlfriend-tiktok.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Ilasi- Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Tiktok</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
