former Bravo star told a South Carolina judge during their custody war that he plans to move the children out of Charleston and to an estate in Aiken, South Carolina this summer.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun

for sole custody of the kids&nbsp;and requested&nbsp;Kathryn&nbsp;have supervised visitation</a>&nbsp;on October 23, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>In South Carolina court records obtained by The Sun, Thomas claimed a mutual friend told him about a&nbsp;<a href=#>recent trip he took to North Carolina</a>&nbsp;with Kathryn, her&nbsp;<a href=#>boyfriend Chleb Ravenell</a>, Kensie, Saint and others.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas claimed the friend said: “He informed me that he witnessed a lot of cocaine use during this trip and that Kathryn had left cocaine within grasp of the children, which he thought was dangerous.”</p><p>Kathryn alleged in her court response: “I do not use cocaine so naturally I have not left any out for our children to access.”</p><p>Thomas continued that Kathryn has failed to get the children to school on time.</p><p>Kathryn admitted in her filing that her daughter has been late to school four times this year and three of those tardies were during her visitation period.&nbsp;</p><h2>"Filthy and unkempt"</h2><p>He said the&nbsp;<a href=#>children come to him from their mother's home</a>&nbsp;allegedly “filthy and unkempt," according to the court documents.</p><p>He claimed: “When the children are picked up after their week with Kathryn, they are filthy, their hair is matted, they smell and they are unusually tired and irritable.&nbsp;</p><p>“During the summer they were routinely returned without shoes. Saint is regularly returned wearing clothes that are so small on him, they leave marks on his skin.”</p><p>Kathryn&nbsp;<a href=#>responded to the claim</a>: “This is untrue. My children are always well dressed and clean when in my care and I am often complimented on how cute they look.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Home alone</h2><p>Thomas went on to claim that he hired a man to conduct surveillance on her, as he&nbsp;witnessed the&nbsp;<a href=#>Southern Charm</a>&nbsp;star leaving the children home alone unsupervised “on multiple occasions,” noting one time in July at 1:48am, in August at 3:17am and others, according to court papers.</p><p>Thomas wrote in the court papers of one alleged instance: “During the time Kathryn was gone, Kensie and Saint are seen alone in front of the house. THIS IS TERRIFYING.”</p><p>Kathryn&nbsp;<a href=#>responded in her court filing</a>&nbsp;that it is “untrue” she left the children in the home alone.&nbsp;</p><p>He also <a href=#>claimed she was “broke,”</a> as she only had $11 in her bank account.</p><p>Thomas said he found a private school in Aiken, South Carolina willing to take both students beginning with the 2021-2022 academic school year.&nbsp;</p><p>He believed it was in the children’s best interests to move to Aiken, South Carolina, as he can maintain a “safe, stable and secure environment” for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas planned to move into the home with the children this summer, as he proposed his plan to the judge when requesting full custody.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas ultimately won full custody, as Kathryn has supervised visitation every other weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun reported there <a href=#>has been a “marked improvement”</a> since the children have been with&nbsp;Thomas full time.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>A source previously told The Sun: “In Kensie's latest report card, her teacher wrote that ‘Kensie is starting to SOAR academically.&nbsp;Her reading is taking off and she rarely needs assistance in math.’"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>As for Saint</a>, the insider said: “The school administrator remarked on Saint's recent stark behavioral improvement.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kathryn now lives<a href=#> with her boyfriend Chleb Ravenell</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670683212.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670121075-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670121432.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZGWCdoGPaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdYsGpu8yaqmaqkauyr7HLZp%2BopZViuKLAx6uwp2WTqsC1u8OyZKWno6h8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-solve-the-alignment-control-center-puzzle-jedi-survivor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steps on How to Solve the Alignment Control Center Puzzle in 'Jedi: Survivor'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./google-maps-show-speed-cameras.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Google Maps will now show you where speed cameras are</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
