Marvel’s <strong>Jacob Batalon</strong> spent most of 2020 focusing on his overall health, which resulted in a 112-pound weight loss.</p><p>“I decided to get into this sort of transformation, or this sort of journey, with my health and fitness at the end of 2019,” Batalon, 25, explained to <a href=#>Men’s Health</a> in an interview published on Friday, December 17. “Even when I wasn’t doing anything physical, I found myself getting sleepy at work and it was because of all the fat food I was eating.”</p><p><a href=#>The Spider-Man: Homecoming star recalled</a> a specific turning point that made him reconsider his diet and exercise regimen.</p><p>“I felt like I could barely walk up stairs without being out of breath and this one day I kind of just saw myself without a shirt on and it was just ridiculous,” he noted, citing the moment as a wake-up call. . “I could not believe I let myself get this far. That’s what sort of started it all.”</p><p>With the help of a trainer, Batalon created a system that worked for him and ended up losing more than 100 pounds. “I found a lot of light in the dark in the sense that a lot of people were suffering and I was fortunate and lucky enough to have found my health and all those things,” he told the outlet.</p><p>After committing to improving his fitness, the Avengers star started visiting the gym six days a week. Each session includes a 90-minute workout of lunges, burpees and lifting weights. Batalon’s routine, which mixes weights and cardio, <a href=#>is accompanied by a healthier meal plan.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/How-Spider-Mans-Jacob-Batalon-Lost-More-Than-100-Lbs-02.jpg><p>“Recently, my girlfriend has actually gotten me into a plant-based diet, as well, and that’s really helped my body and I can feel the difference between eating a lot of meat and eating plant-based stuff and that’s really helped me, as well,” Batalon told Men’s Health.</p><p>In addition to his personal accomplishments, Batalon is <a href=#>also proud of the achievements he’s made in his professional life</a>. The Hawaii native <a href=#>recently reprised his role as Ned Leeds in Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>, which he considered “a storybook ending” to the trio of films.</p><p>“We all started out very naive and unsure of what the future held for us. I could speak for all of us — we’ve accomplished everything that we wanted to do with the films and our character arcs,” the Day by Day actor, who stars alongside <a href=#><strong>Tom Holland</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Zendaya</strong></a> in the superhero movie, told <a href=#>Grumpy Magazine</a> earlier this month. “I think we can absolutely walk away from it knowing that everything has satisfactorily ended.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Batalon felt excited for fans to finally see the film, hinting that it had a “surprise” that viewers “won’t believe.”</p><p>He added at the time, “They will be in for a ride that is so unbelievable. They are going to have to watch it a few more times because it’s all happening in such a crazy way. I cannot tease anything specially. All I can say is that people are going to be blown.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasqJmZsrN5zJqlZquklr9utsCcpptlkpbBorjOp2SdnaSWtq2%2FjKGgrGVhZn9uuMFmrp6hl53BbrjOrKpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dobie-gray-19400726-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dobie Gray (Soul Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-welcomes-first-baby-with-asap-rocky.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna Welcomes First Baby with A$AP Rocky</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
