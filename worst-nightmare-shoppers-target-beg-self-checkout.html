self-checkout area amid frantic shopping for the holiday season.</p><p>Several fans took to <a href=#>social media</a> to request that more lanes and kiosks be opened for a more efficient experience as they grab last-minute <a href=#>Christmas</a> gifts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/2018-denver-colorado-second-urban-867501325.jpg><p>Some claimed that their local <a href=#>Target</a> stores either had the <a href=#>self-checkout</a> area blocked off or only a few kiosks open to a flood of shoppers waiting in line.</p><p>"Not a single self checkout at target is open this literally my worst nightmare lol," one person <a aria-label="fumed (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fumed</a> in a post to X, formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Another pleaded that more be opened to get through crowds.</p><p>"I am BEGGING Target to get more self-checkout in all stores," they <a href=# aria-label="wrote (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Target">Read More on Target</h2><p>"The line with 4 self-checkout registers at this time of year ain’t it."</p><p>Others had the opposite problem, with one claiming that their Target location had only self-checkouts open but no cashiered lanes.</p><p>"Target at Christmas time, only self checkout line open," a shopper <a href=# aria-label="claimed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> on X.</p><p>"Wonderful service."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>As The U.S. Sun previously reported, it's no secret that Target has been experimenting <a href=#>with different anti-theft measures</a> and checkout experiences on a seemingly store-by-store basis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>STRICT COUNT</h2><p>A shopper <a href=#>pointed out in a viral video</a> earlier this month that their Target store took drastic steps to mitigate shoplifting troubles.</p><p>In the clip, a sign was posted outside detailing an age limit for entrance of 18 years and above without an accompanying adult.</p><p>The self-checkout section at the store could also be seen completely blocked off — only cashiered lanes open.</p><p>In October, a Target spokesperson also confirmed to The U.S. Sun that it would be <a href=#>implementing a new self-checkout rule</a> at select stores to improve efficiency.</p><p>Shoppers at the stores would be limited to a 10-item maximum, otherwise they'd have to see a cashier.</p><p>"At select locations, we are testing self-checkout lanes of 10 items or fewer in order to reduce wait times and better understand guest preferences," the Target spokesperson wrote in an email.</p><p>Even so, the retail giant <a href=#>already faced backlash from some shoppers</a> online in December about the change, claiming there aren't enough cashiered lanes open if turned away from self-checkout for too many items.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'REASONABLE NUMBER'</h2><p>"Seriously Target you can't kick me out of the '10 items or less' self-checkout unless you open a reasonable number of staffed registers," a frustrated customer <a href=# aria-label="said (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on X.</p><p>"Tonight I was denied a 2-minute checkout of 19 small items and had to wait in 1 of 4 staffed lines (out of 14) to receive a 15-minute checkout."</p><p>Others claimed to have had similar experiences.</p><p>"Dear Target, if you are going to make self-checkout lanes 10 items or less, you need to have more than 2 regular registers open,"&nbsp;another customer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p><p>"So many abandoned carts and items left around because people don’t have time to stand in line for 20 mins to get 12 items…SC should be 20 items."</p><p>Target COO John Mulligan said the rule was part of an effort to <a href=#>improve its front-of-store experience</a>.</p><p>Mulligan explained that the company wants "consistently great service through the in-store checkout experience, along with drive-up and in-store pickup" in a statement.</p><p>"And because our guests tell us they enjoy interacting with our team since we’ve refocused on the front-end experience, we’ve seen more than a 6 percentage point increase in the usage of full-service lanes across the chain."</p><p>Target has been going through significant changes this fall since it announced the <a href=#>closure of at least nine stores</a> at the end of September.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For more related content, check out The U.S. Sun's coverage of a shopper who claimed <a href=#>they boycotted the company for the holiday season</a>, saying, "I never stepped foot in Target this Christmas."</p><p>The U.S. Sun also has the story of a Target shopper <a href=#>who claimed they lost $200</a> in a store location.</p><p class=postsid
