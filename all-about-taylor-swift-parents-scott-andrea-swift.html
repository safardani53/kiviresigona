She effusively thanked both her parents for their support in her acceptance speech, dedicating the award to her dad.

Though the family later moved to Nashville, Taylor has always spoken fondly of her memories on the farm, even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>returning to pay a visit there</a> in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She later commemorated her childhood home in her 2021 song "Christmas Tree Farm," on which she sings about her happy holiday memories from growing up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-named-her-with-a-business-career-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They named her with a business career in mind</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both of Taylor's parents have backgrounds in the financial industry, something which influenced the moniker they chose for her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My mom thought it was cool that if you got a business card that said 'Taylor' you wouldn't know if it was a guy or a girl," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> in 2009, explaining that they thought an androgynous name could help reduce any potential discrimination in the corporate world.

Andrea was supportive from the start, driving Taylor to Nashville to hand out demos of her singing karaoke.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My mom waited in the car with my little brother while I knocked on doors up and down Music Row," Taylor told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2008. "I would say, 'Hi, I'm Taylor. I'm 11. I wanted a record deal — call me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon returning from that fateful Nashville trip — where no one did call her — Taylor decided to take up guitar and focus on songwriting in order to help herself stand out. When her parents initially tried to dissuade her from starting with a 12-string guitar, suggesting that her fingers were still "too small," she immediately set out to prove them wrong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Don't ever say never or can't do to Taylor.

While the move was made in service of then-14-year-old Taylor's budding career, her parents strove to keep the pressure off of her, promising the move was "a change of scenery."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I never wanted to make that move about her 'making it,"' Andrea told EW. "Because what a horrible thing if it hadn't happened, for her to carry that kind of guilt or pressure around." Meanwhile, Scott moved the financial advisory business where'd he worked for nearly three decades — The Swift Group, under Merrill Lynch — to their new home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of the reason they didn't move directly to Nashville was to offer Taylor a buffer against the trappings of fame as well, Andrea revealed. "And we moved far enough outside Nashville to where she didn't have to be going to school with producers' kids and label presidents' kids and be reminded constantly that she was struggling to make it," she explained. "We've always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scott-gets-a-kick-out-of-embarrassing-taylor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scott gets a kick out of embarrassing Taylor</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rick Diamond/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like any stereotypical dad, Scott got a kick out of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>embarrassing his teenage daughter</a> — but Taylor took it all in stride.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My dad is along the ride for this trip," she wrote on MySpace in 2009.

"Usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later. This is something my family and I thought you should know about now." She went on to explain that during a routine check-up which she'd encouraged her mom to get, doctors discovered Andrea had cancer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know," Taylor added. "She wanted you to know why she may not be at as many shows this tour. She's got an important battle to fight."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a reflective personal essay for Elle in 2019, Taylor revealed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her mom's cancer had returned</a>. "It's taught me that there are real problems and then there's everything else. My mom's cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs," she said, adding that her priorities had since shifted. "I give all of my worry, stress and prayers to real problems now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the same essay, Taylor shared that her dad Scott had also previously been diagnosed with cancer, though she didn't share specific details about his health journey. "Both of my parents have had cancer," she wrote in part, going on to expand on her mom's condition without elaborating on her dad's.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While undergoing treatment for cancer, Andrea was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>also diagnosed with a brain tumor</a>, Taylor revealed in 2020 to Variety.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone loves their mom; everyone's got an important mom," Taylor told the outlet, going on to express how the news was impacting their family. "But for me, she's really the guiding force. Almost every decision I make, I talk to her about it first. So obviously it was a really big deal to ever speak about her illness."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that it was "a really hard time" for her family, explaining that "the symptoms of what a person goes through when they have a brain tumor is nothing like what we've ever been through with her cancer before."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-andrea-introduced-taylor-at-the-2015-academy-of-country-music-awards></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Andrea introduced Taylor at the 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cooper Neill/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just over a week after her first cancer diagnosis was shared with fans, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Andrea joined Taylor onstage</a> at the ACM Awards, where the singer was being honored with the Milestone Award.

What am I supposed to do? If there's no you." During a YouTube Live, Taylor revealed that it was a family decision to ultimately include the song on the album. "It's something I'm so proud of, but it's just really hard. I can't sing it.
