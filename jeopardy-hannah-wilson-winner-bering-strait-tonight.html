Not a moment of doubt, tension, nerves, insecurity," one Twitter user wrote.</p><p>"Go Hannah! Are you going to beat Ken’s score!? Lots of luck!" wrote another, though she's still 73 wins away from doing so.</p><p>A third fan agreed that this could be a long streak and wrote: "I’m settling in. It’s gonna be another person who goes on forever. Hannah loves to go in for the kill."</p><p>A fourth wrote on <a href=#>Reddit</a>: "Very impressive performance by Hannah! She clearly has a broad base of knowledge, and I'm looking forward to seeing her go on a run."</p><p>A fifth remarked: "If Hannah had bet $23,999 in Final Jeopardy (max she could bet and still be guaranteed a win), she'd have a higher two day total than <a href=#>James Holhzauer.</a>"</p><p>"Regardless, it'll be interesting if Hannah survives long enough to encounter <a href=#>Ben Chan</a> on May 15th."</p><h2>AMY SCHNEIDER IS A FAN</h2><p>Jeopardy! fans aren't the only ones geeking out, as some of the show's most major stars took to Twitter telling any haters to buzz off.</p><p><a href=#>Amy Schneider</a> tweeted: Huge congratulations to Hannah Wilson!!! Welcome to the Guild of Jeopardy Champion Trans Women, one of us will be in contact shortly to explain the secret handshake and so forth."</p><p><a href=#>Mattea Roach</a> also clapped back on <a href=#>Twitter</a> at anyone trying to give new star Hannah a hard time, they wrote: "lots of people hating from outside the club…"</p><p>Hannah has found five of six daily doubles so far and only missed 3 clues in two games.</p><h2>PROMISING PLAYER!</h2><p>Hannah's $71,200 in two games is not to be taken lightly - it's the second-highest two-game total this season.</p><p>That, and it's been a quiet few months on the game show- there hasn't been a four-plus day streak since March nor a <a href=#>$200K-plus winner since Troy Meyer</a> in February.</p><p>In terms of that total, <a href=#>21-day winner Cris Pannulo's</a> first two wins amounted to <a href=#>$63,379,</a> while <a href=#>6-day quiz whiz Troy Meyer's</a> added up to <a href=#>$62.6K</a> - both less.</p><p>Only the <a href=#>infamous 3-day winner Yogesh Raut</a> has outdone her this season with <a href=#>$74K</a>, before going out on a blaze on game four.</p><p>Meanwhile, September's 2023 Tournament of Champions - which consists of 4+ day winners from the current season - as it currently stands, <a href=#>is only male contestants,</a> all of which adds up to right place, right time for Hannah.</p><h2>MAY-IM, JUNE, JULY...</h2><p>Meanwhile, actress <a href=#>Mayim</a> returned as host this week for the first time on regularly airing&nbsp;Jeopardy! in quite some time.</p><p>It had been 10 months barring a recent teen tournament that she's hosted, and she opened Monday's show admitting it's been a while.</p><p>“I'm thrilled to be back on the Alex Trebek stage," Mayim said before launching into her first game back.</p><p>GOAT champion <a href=#>Ken</a> is off the board until next fall as Mayim is hosting the remaining four months of the season.</p><p>His hiatus is not going over well with everyone as one fan wrote on Twitter this week: "Took five minutes before I started to miss Ken."</p><p>Another wrote: "I love Jeopardy but can't stand those&nbsp;<a href=#>pauses</a>&nbsp;she does. She's probably a really nice person but damn she's annoying with the pauses."</p><p>And a third tweeted tonight: "I don’t understand this. Respectfully, I thought Mayim was only going to be hosting 'special' tournaments. I don’t get it."</p><p>Ken will not be helming regularly airing episodes until next September.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>When Ken returns he will kick Season 40 off with the Tournament of Champions, which will be the start of the season.</p><p>Ken will be hosting the three-week-long&nbsp;<a href=#>$500K Jeopardy!
