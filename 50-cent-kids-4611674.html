With his single “In Da Club” becoming the most listened-to song in radio history within a week at the time, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>, the 47-year-old Queens, New York native, quickly became a household name. He then started his own music label, G-Unit Records, and swept the charts again with his third studio effort, 2005’s The Massacre.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Since then, 50 Cent, whose real name is <strong>Curtis Jackson, </strong>has gone on to release several more albums, starred in a film and even began his own production companies. He not only stars in the hit Starz drama <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Power</a>, but also serves as co-creator and executive producer. He also has his hand in many business ventures, including SMS Audio and SK Energy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In his personal life, 50 Cent has welcomed two sons with two different women. Although he is estranged to his eldest son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Marquise Jackson</strong></a> and currently in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bitter feud with him</a>, the entertainer often gushes over his youngest, <strong>Sire Jackson</strong>. Find out all about Fiddy’s relationship with his boys, below.</p><h2>Marquise Jackson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/50-Cent-Kids-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Marquise, who was born on October 13, 1997, is a rapper and actor who has been estranged from his father for over a decade, due in part to the rapper’s tumultuous split with Marquise’s mother, <strong>Shaniqua</strong> <strong>Thompkins</strong>, in 2008. After the former couple went their separate ways, Shaniqua claimed 50 Cent promised her his $4 million Long Island Mansion. While she and Marquise were residing in it, the house burned to the ground, with Shaniqua alleging her ex had something to do with it. Although 50 Cent was cleared of any wrongdoing, the former couple continued to feud, which has resulted in a rift between <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fiddy and Marquise</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“It completely went south when I was probably like 10 or 11,” Marquise told&nbsp;<a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=external-disclaimer data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rap-Up</a> in 2017. “He wasn’t really around enough. It kind of dwindled down as time went on and certain events happened.” He said he always thought of his father as Superman while he was growing up. “But then, as I got older, you start realizing things or you start seeing certain patterns and it takes an effect on your relationship with people,” Marquise added. “That’s what happened with me and my father. He’s still alive but I can’t tell you our last conversation or the last time we even had a dialogue.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>feud has escalated</a> since, with 50 Cent saying he wouldn’t mind if Marquise was “hit by a bus” in 2018. The insult came after Marquise shared a snap of himself hanging out with the son of <strong>Supreme McGriff</strong>, one of 50’s rivals, on Instagram. Fiddy commented, “if both these little n—-s got hit by a bus, I wouldn’t have a bad day.” Although the “Candy Shop” singer walked back the comment, tweeting he had “zero ill will towards anyone living,” the damage had been done. 50 Cent also said he spent $1,360,000 to give Marquise opportunities.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>On Oct. 19, 2022, Fif appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Breakfast Club</a>&nbsp;radio show to talk about the relationship with the now 26-year-old. “I don’t think the relationship works,” Fifty told&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Charlamagne tha</strong> <strong>God</strong></a>. After the lengthy interview where the rapper said that he doesn’t believe his son actually wants to sit down and talk, Marquise took <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to Instagram</a> to call out his dad. “Now y’all all see I tried to reach out to talk to&nbsp;my pops&nbsp;as a MAN in front of the [earth emoji] & behind the scenes. I have no phone number for you & You’ve had me blocked on social media for years so I can’t DM you personally & everybody that is mutual is scared to touch the topic bc they’re scared of you,” Marquise captioned the throwback photo of him and Fif.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The post also comes just over a week after 50 Cent called Marquise “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>entitled</a>” and his son also responded to the statement via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Since y’all think $6,700 is sooo much money someone tell my pops I will pay him $6,700 for just 24hr of his time so we can do everything I ever wanted to do with him as a kid Red Yellow Green whatever color he like,” Marquise captioned the Oct. 10, 2022, photo.</p><h2>Sire Jackson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/50-Cent-Kids-embed-1-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Sire, on the other hand, appears to be the apple of 50 Cent’s eye. Born on September 1, 2012 to Fiddy and his girlfriend at the time, model <strong>Daphne Joy</strong>, Sire has already been living the high life. When he was just 2 years old, he landed a $700,000 contract with&nbsp;Kidz Safe headphones. “He’s got a [modeling] deal now with Kidz Safe,” 50 Cent announced during an interview with Power 105.1, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> E!</a><strong>. “</strong>They paid him a big payment, too. He’s super cute, you gotta pay for it.” The doting dad also revealed he set up a trust fund for Sire, saying he wanted his son to enjoy his riches when he was more mature.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>And speaking of riches, in 2019 Fiddy treated Sire to an insane shopping spree for Christmas. The actor spent $100,000 to rent out an entire Toys R Us store for the little tyke to shop ’til he dropped, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E!</a>. The exciting day was revealed on Daphne’s Instagram, where she posted several pics of the holiday surprise, captioning it, “When I asked my Dad for the ‘WHOLE Toys R Us Store’ for Christmas I didn’t think he would actually do it, but he did.” Another post read, “Sire’s in utter shock right now and disbelief.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>50 Cent also gushed about Sire during the 2021 Christmas holiday. Posting adorable pics of Sire wearing a tiger hat and hoodie by a Christmas tree, he wrote, “look at my boy, SIRE on some let’s play video games for money DadNo . you ain’t got no money so i can’t win. LOL” Looks like Sire is in for many more special holidays in the years ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme5RpZJydnql6rLXDrGRtbmFmg3iAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alison-hammonds-floral-dress-on-bake-off-where-to-buy-episode-4-outfit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alison Hammonds floral dress on Bake Off Where to buy episode 4 outfit Thu 19 October 20</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./martyn-meade-updates-us-on-his-investec-derby-contender-eminent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Martyn Meade updates us on his Investec Derby contender Eminent The Sun</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
