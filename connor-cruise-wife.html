But after he was photographed with daughter Bella Cruise, people are wondering about his son, <a href=#><u>Connor Cruise</u></a>, and what his life is like mostly out of the spotlight.</p><p>In a way, Tom has done the right thing in shielding his kids from the harsh light of the public. Clearly, he has had his own run-ins with less than favorable publicity. But in doing so, he has created even more mystique surrounding them and plenty of questions from the public about who his kids are and what his relationship with them is really like.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Connor Cruise's wife?</h2><p>In 2019, Connor married fellow Scientologist Silvia Zanchi. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her Instagram</u></a> is private, according to Women‚Äôs Day Australia, Silvia is not only part of the religion, but she is also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a staff member</u></a> from Italy who moved to Florida and met Connor there. She is also from a family of devoted parishioners. And, by all accounts, she is faithful to their shared religion. So much so that Connor‚Äôs mom, Nicole Kidman, was allegedly barred from attending the ceremony.</p><p>Silvia is rumored to be a high-ranking member of the Church of Scientology and, although there has been no confirmation that Connor‚Äôs marriage to her was arranged, the rumors are rampant that that‚Äôs exactly what happened. Still, despite being part of a religion that still has people asking so many questions and is often in the spotlight, Connor and Silvia appear to enjoy their privacy for the most part.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Hangin with Bellz in London</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Connor Cruise</a> (@theconnorcruise) on Jul 23, 2013 at 5:18am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Connor Cruise doesn't seem to have much contact with his mom, Nicole Kidman.</h2><p>Not only did Nicole, who left Scientology in 1997, not attend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Connor‚Äôs wedding</u></a>, but she was also absent from daughter Bella‚Äôs. There have long since been rumors that Nicole isn't close to either of her adult children, and in 2018, she spoke candidly to Who magazine about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>relationship with her kids</u></a> and her support for their life choices.</p><p>"They are adults," Nicole said, of Connor and Bella. "They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and as a mother, it‚Äôs my job to love them. And I am an example of that tolerance and that‚Äôs what I believe ‚Äî that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love and I‚Äôm open here."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è @nickavasilaros @kingsmenfishing #40club #tampabay #clearwater #gausebuilt @wet_lines_fishing @marker1marina @pelagicgear</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Connor Cruise</a> (@theconnorcruise) on Jul 27, 2019 at 6:50pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Connor Cruise's job?</h2><p>Over the years, Connor has tried his hand at acting and even had a small following as a DJ, but these days, it looks like he has devoted his life to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deep-sea fishing</u></a> where he lives in Clearwater, Fla. In 2018, he even competed in and came in third for the Rotary Club of Clearwater's Kingfish Tournament with his team. Connor doesn't often update his Instagram or give interviews, but he seems to keep plenty busy with his wife and changing careers.</p><p>Unfortunately, that just means people are going to continue to wonder about what goes on behind closed doors while he continues to live that Scientology life. And for now, with Tom Cruise as his dad and plenty of questions from those outside of Scientology about the religion itself, that‚Äôs likely exactly what will happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyvus6rZJyqpZ7ApnnWop2e</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-kal-penn-still-on-clarice.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Kal Penn Still on 'Clarice'?
