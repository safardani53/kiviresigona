Originating from Full House, the actor and comedian has been working in prominent TV shows such as America’s Funniest Home Videos and How I Met Your Mother since 1997. He’s also an author, a voice actor, and, most importantly, humanitarian fighting to discover a cure for the illness Scleroderma. Let’s take a look at what sort of guy Bob Saget is, how he makes his money, what he does in his spare time, and stories of his charity.</p><h2>Bob Saget’s Net Worth and Salary</h2><p>For a long time, Bob has been a TV program celebrity. From portraying Danny Tanner on Full House to performing stand-up comedy tours, he’s become one of the most adored celebrities of all time.&nbsp;The comedian’s sold-out gigs are now his major source of income. He is now traveling the United States and Canada, playing in a variety of venues. The majority of his gigs are already sold out, with tickets ranging from $35 to $45 and special tickets going for as much as $880!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bob-Saget-1.jpg alt="Bob Saget" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bob has been quite fortunate in terms of money for a long time. Following his part in Danny Tanner, he became the presenter of America’s Funniest Home Videos in 1989, a position he kept for over 8 years.&nbsp;He continued to work with AFV in the early 1990s, but then moved into filmmaking, directing the 1996 film with Hope. Then he went on to direct Dirty Work, which grossed $10 million at the box office.&nbsp;Following that, he worked as a voice actor for the successful show “How I Met Your Mother.” Following that, he worked on the Full House sequel “Fuller House” for Netflix.&nbsp;And, well, all of this has contributed to Bob Saget’s legacy. He’s now one of the most in-demand comedians, and all he does is travel and perform in front of large crowds.</p><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>He is a touring comedian, as previously said. He travels places, hangs out, does his stuff, and generally lives in the present.&nbsp;He likes reuniting with friends and audiences from all around the world. Despite the fact that he has been a stand-up comedian since he was 17, he still finds ways to enjoy his life as much as he can.&nbsp;Aside from that, he enjoys spending time with his three children whenever feasible. Aside from that, he is a huge cigar smoker.</p><p>Not many people are aware that he often hangs out with artist John Mayer. They seem to be great friends, and John has even performed at numerous of Saget’s charity events.&nbsp;He must have a strong social media presence as a social comedian. And, to be honest, he does a good job of keeping it up. He even has a Snapchat account!&nbsp;He typically posts his own material, but he and his wife often take over and post photographs of them being nice together.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Bob Saget has done a lot for charity, which is one of the reasons why people like him.&nbsp;He has played important roles in providing comfort to persons suffering from Scleroderma.&nbsp;It might be because his own sister died as a result of this condition. In 1987, the actor and comedian aided the Scleroderma Research Foundation in the founding of Cool Comedy, a fundraiser.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bob-Saget-2.jpg alt="Bob Saget" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In commemoration of his sister’s memory, Bob Saget joined the Scleroderma Research Foundation and worked as a board member for over a decade to find a cure.&nbsp;For the last decade or so, the foundation has done very well. They’ve amassed a sizable amount of roughly $45 million so far!&nbsp;Not only has he performed simply for charitable purposes on several occasions. In 2019, he organized a fundraiser that included various TV and movie stars.&nbsp;A number of notable things were auctioned off, and at the conclusion of the night, they’d raised $750,000, which was donated to Scleroderma research.</p><h2>Bob Saget Career</h2><p>Even before he became famous via TV series, Bob Saget was a stand-up comedian. Despite being a touring comic, he never achieved success in this lineup until he discovered Funny House.&nbsp;His formal position as Danny Tanner in the series drew attention to him, and he began to develop. The program ended after eight seasons. Then he moved on to America’s Funniest Home Videos and became a host there.</p><p>He lived there until 1997, when he directed “For Hope,” a TV movie in memory of his late sister. In 1998, he released his debut feature picture, “Dirty Work.” In addition, in 2001, he joined the cast of “Raising Dad,” which lasted just a few episodes. His biggest break in a long time came when he played future Ted Mosby in “How I Met Your Mother.” In 2007, he had a comedy special on HBO called “That Ain’t Right.” He then created and directed the spoof film “Farce of the Penguin.”&nbsp;He went on to undertake lesser jobs in other TV series later in his career. In 2014, he published his first novel, “Dirty Daddy.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZqJpdqK6osdOsZKedpGLEsL7ToWShp6div6qvx2agrGWYmnqttcWeqq2xnJp6orrDZpqaqpWav260yKCfpaGXncG0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-gyllenhaal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Gyllenhaal Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-thorne-covers-gq-mexico.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Thorne Covers GQ Mexico</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
