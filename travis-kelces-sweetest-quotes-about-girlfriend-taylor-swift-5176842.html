You might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit,” he teased during an appearance on <i>The Pat McAfee Show.</i><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>‘Shout-out to Taylor’<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>After the “Bad Blood” singer attended her first game at Arrowhead Stadium, Travis said Taylor was “pretty ballsy” for showing up.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I’m enjoying life and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend,” the athlete said on his podcast in September. “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy. … I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her — the friends and family. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Travis added, “To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with mom [<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Donna Kelce</b></a>], to see how, you know, Chiefs kingdom was all excited that she was there — that s**t was absolutely hysterical, and it was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for damn sure.”</p><h2>‘Even More on Top of the World’<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>While speaking at a press conference in October, the football player said he felt “even more on top of the world” than he felt after winning the Super Bowl in the past.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>‘I Feel Terrible for Taylor’<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>After the award-winning songwriter attended <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her third Chiefs game</a>, Travis joked that he “felt terrible” that his girlfriend had to talk to his dad,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b> Ed Kelce</b></a>, during the game.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“You know dad like I know dad,” Travis said to Jason on the brothers’ podcast in October. “This is a terrifying conversation. I felt terrible for Taylor for being in this.”</p><h2>‘Protective’ on Dates</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>During the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>same podcast episode</a>, Travis and Jason rehashed all the buzz surrounding photos that surfaced of Travis and Taylor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in New York City</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I feel like whenever I’m on a date, I’m always having the sense of like, I’m a man in the situation, I’m, like, protective, yeah for sure,” the two-time Super Bowl winner said. “You always kind of have that feeling — or that self-awareness, I guess.”</p><h2>His Reaction to the ‘Karma’ Lyric Change</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>While Taylor hasn’t really spoken about their romance publicly, she did give Travis a nod during her Argentina concert, where she c<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hanged a line in the song</a> “Karma” to be “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>After the fact, Travis talked about it on his&nbsp;New Heights&nbsp;podcast. He revealed that it was a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>major moment for him.</a> “I had no clue… well, I might of had a little bit of a clue, but definitely when I heard it come out of her mouth still shocked me,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The tight end also apologized to Taylor’s dad after he snubbed him for a high five in his excitement. “I missed that. I never miss a high five, too. Big high five guy. It’s the most electric thing you can do at an event. So, sorry, Mr. Swift,” he said.</p><h2>He’s ‘Never Dated Anyone Like’ Taylor Swift</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>He spoke more<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> at length about his relationship</a> with Taylor during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WSJ</a>&nbsp;magazine, published on November 20, 2023. He said that he “never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them.” He proceeded to talk about how different it was to date her with all the public attention on her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Travis also spoke more about how he thinks their values align. “Her team is her family. Her family does a lot of stuff in terms of the tour, the marketing, being around, so I think she has a lot of those values as well, which is right up my alley,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>He also detailed their first meeting, after some time talking. “When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there,” he said.</p><h2>‘Love’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>While speaking on his “New Heights” podcast, Travis told his brother, Jason, his thoughts about his WSJ Magazine cover story, and fans believed they heard him say he loves Taylor.</p><a title=@teresacherman href=# rel=nofollow>@teresacherman</a><p id=content-paragraph-23>I take that as a Yes!! <a title=taylorswift href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#taylorswift</a> <a title=traviskelce href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#traviskelce</a> <a title=tayvis href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#tayvis</a> <a title=newheightspodcast href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#newheightspodcast</a> <a title=lovestory href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#lovestory</a> <a title=lover href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#lover</a> <a title=swifties href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#swifties</a> <a title=eras href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#eras</a> <a title=erastour href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#erastour</a> <a title=swiftiesoftiktok href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#swiftiesoftiktok</a> <a title=theerastour href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#theerastour</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-24><a title="♬ original sound - Teresa C Herman" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – Teresa C Herman</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-26>“They did an awesome job with the article,” he explained. “I thought it was cool how they showcased just my love for not only Kansas City but my love for the people that I have around me.
