With Queen Elizabeth and her late husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Prince Philip </strong></a>leaving <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>four children</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eight grandchildren</a> in the line of succession, there are plenty of people to invite (as fans who are watching the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>latest season</a> of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Crown </a>know). Of course, the recent <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>drama in the Palace</a> might play a part in choosing attendees. Rest assured, however, Princess Anne has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made the cut</a>! Let’s find out more about her, below.</p><h2>She’s The Second Child Of Queen Elizabeth II & Prince Philip</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Princess Anne was born on Aug. 15, 1950 and is the daughter of the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong></a> and late Prince Philip. She is the younger sister to <strong>King Charles</strong>, who was first in line for the throne of England and older sister to <strong>Prince Andrew</strong> and <strong>Prince Edward</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/princess-anne-and-prince-philip-shutterstock-post.jpg><h2>Princess Anne Holds A Very Unique Title</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>While the Royal Family member is widely referred to as Princess Anne, she actually holds the title Princess Royal. As the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, she naturally received the title of Princess upon birth. However, in 1987, the Queen granted her the additional title of the Princess Royal. “It is a title that remains for life,” royal writer <strong>Duncan Larcombe</strong> told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Town & Country.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/princess-anne-and-prince-philip-shutterstock-post2.jpg><h2>She Once Foiled Her Own Kidnapping Plot</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>As royalists and fans of the famous family know all too well, Princess Anne has a very stern and fierce personality. So much so that in 1974, she stopped an attempt made by a 26-year-old man to kidnap her. Anne was being driven in a limo when a car swerved in front of her chauffeur. The young assailant got out of his car and began shooting at Anne’s guard, injuring a number of people. Once he was in the limo, himself, her would-be kidnapper tried to force her out of the car, but she wouldn’t budge. “It was all so infuriating; I kept saying I didn’t want to get out of the car, and I was not going to get out of the car,” she said, <a class=body-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>according to the BBC</a>. “I nearly lost my temper with him, but I knew that if I did, I should hit him and he would shoot me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/princess-anne-ignored-trump-shutterstock-post.jpg><h2>She Loves Equestrianism</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Like many members of the Royal Family, Princess Anne loves to ride horses. But instead of polo, the royal is a big Equestrian rider and has enjoyed the sport since she was very young. In fact, in 1976, Princess Anne competed in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olympic Games</a> and rode one of her mother’s own horses. She now serves as the President of the British Olympic Association and a member of the International Olympic Committee.</p><h2>Princess Anne Has Been Married Twice</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>During Anne’s time as a young royal, divorce was quite taboo and often looked down upon by the Royal Family. However, both she, and her brother Prince Charles and Prince Andrew along with her aunt <strong>Princess Margaret</strong> would each divorce their first spouses. Following her 19-year marriage to&nbsp;<strong>Mark Phillips</strong>, whom she had two children with (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Zara Phillips </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Peter Phillips</strong></a>), Princess Anne went on to marry&nbsp;<strong>Timothy Laurence&nbsp;</strong>in 1992 and they have been together since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K9s7XNnJysq12Wu6%2BxjKumspmcYrOiucilsGallaKvpr6MqqyenZ5isq212ZqZnqyYYraqecOarKCgpJq%2Fbn%2BXamxvcGNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./awkwafina-says-her-grandmother-walked-out-of-the-farewell-at-the-most-pivotal-part-to-cook.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Awkwafina's Grandmother Walked Out of The Farewell</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./naked-swimming-lessons-public-pool-nude-bathe-strangers-children-free.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Naked swimming lessons offered by public pool where people can bathe nude with strangers - and kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
