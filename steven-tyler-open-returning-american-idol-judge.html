While attending Steven Tyler’s Grammy-viewing party benefiting Janie’s Fund (which helps “bring hope and healing to girls who have suffered the trauma of abuse and neglect,” according to the fund’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mission statement</a>), <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> got a chance to talk with the rock star about whether he’d come back to American Idol&nbsp;as a mentor following his departure from the show in 2012. “It depends on who’s on with me,” he told us. “I really think that Randy was — maybe people would say he was good for his time. He was great for his time. He was 10 years a leader and then he would walk out, ‘Yo dog!’ and we’d be sitting there for 8 hours, seeing kid after kid after kid — like 300 kids in Minneapolis auditioning, and you’re sitting there like, ‘Oh hey!’ Some people get dressed up in the car, as a car, other girls, red lipstick and you know. And he made the best of it of some times that weren’t so good, but would I do it? Yeah, I’ll do it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Later on in the group portion of the interview, Steven opened up about <strong>Aerosmith</strong>‘s upcoming Las Vegas residency, which spans from April 6 to December 4. After <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> asked how excited he was for the residency, Steven replied, “Good question! I didn’t know what I was getting into doing American Idol. Sitting next to JLo and Randy — once I had lunch with him. I met him over at the Sunset Marquis. I knew that I could do a TV show with him. I’d never done TV, but to be able to show my personality without being in a rock band was something I had not done and so this also — Vegas?! Isn’t that kind of where you go hang it up? Then I thought about the Rat Pack, and I thought, ‘Wait a minute!’ So we met a bunch of people, people that’ve worked with a lot of great people that have sold out, and our tickets went on sale and we beat them. I’m grateful for that. The meet and greets are sold out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And when it comes to the staging for their residency, audience members can expect it to feel like a huge rock ‘n roll show, as you might expect from Aerosmith. “The side of the stage — we’re in the Park MGM — it’s 150 feet wide,” he went on to say. “We’ve got side seats going; we’ve got a bar on each side; we’ve got a long ramp going out. We’re going to be all over the place! It’s going to be Aerosmith.” After two seasons (the 10th and 11th) as a judge on the show, Steven announced on Jul. 12, 2012 that he’d be leaving the show in a statement: “After some long…hard…thoughts…I’ve decided it’s time for me to let go of my mistress ‘American Idol’ before she boils my rabbit. I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I’m back – but instead of begging on my hands and knees, I’ve got two fists in the air and I’m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass – the ultimate in auditory takeover…On Nov. 6, we are unleashing our new album, Music from Another Dimension on the Earth, Moon, Mars, and way beyond the stars…IDOL was over-the-top fun, and I loved every minute of it…Now it’s time to bring Rock Back. ERMAHGERD.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Meanwhile, in Sep., 2017, Tyler and the rest of Aerosmith had to cancel shows in Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Mexico due to a medical issue. “Steven Tyler is seeking immediate care and has been advised by his doctors that he cannot travel or perform at this time,” the band wrote in a statement at the time. “Therefore, the last four shows of the South American tour will be cancelled. Steven is expected to make a full recovery. With proper rest and treatment he will be back on his feet soon rocking the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH10e49xZqyslauyr3nTsqOeql2kvaa6jKucra2io7avs4yapJ6qmZiur3nInaalZZqqsaixjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./salice-roses-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Salice Rose Dating Salice Rose's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./henry-cejudo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Henry Cejudo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
