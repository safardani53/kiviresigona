The award-winning star has endeared himself to a generation through constant radio hits and vulnerable raps and has effectively become caption material for countless Instagram posts by users worldwide.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of Drake's songs that has stood the test of time most is "Know Yourself," the Canadian rapper's smash hit that birthed the infamous quote "running through the 6 with my woes."</p><p>This quote has been used in countless capacities by fans since the song was released in 2015 and has recently seen a resurgence on <a href=#>TikTok</a>. So, what exactly does the quote mean and how has it been incorporated into TikTok videos? Keep reading to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does "running through the 6 with my woes" actually mean? It's the most famous line from "Know Yourself."</h2><p>Although the entirety of the song "Know Yourself" is chock-full of memorable bars from Drake, the line that has arguably stood the test of time the most out of them all is "running through the 6 with my woes."</p><p>Knowing Drake, it's easy to assume that the line indicates some time of emotional reflection and that he's using the word "woe" literally. However, that isn't exactly the case here, as apparently, the rapper was using "woe" as an acronym for something else.</p><p>Indeed, in a 2015 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Noisey</a>, rapper, producer and OVO Sound affiliate Devontée told the publication that "woe" stands for the crew he and Drake run with in Toronto and not necessarily the hit artist's actual woes.</p><p>He explained that although people may be quick to assume that Drake is talking about his problems, it's a much more personal nod to the people he grew up with.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Woe is my crew. It stands for 'working on excellence.' It's just my whole brand and my whole movement and my way of life for everyone. I want everyone to work on excellence. So, all my friends are my Woes and I feel anybody working on excellence in life is a Woe in life as well," Devontée explained at the time, clearing the air around one of his rapper friend's most famous bars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 2021, the song has taken on a new life in the form of a TikTok trend.</h2><p>Like many hit songs before it, "Know Yourself" has become quite popular on TikTok, specifically the "running through the 6 with my woes" line, which appears to be the focus of the trend. In these videos, users are basically coming to massive realizations about their past actions and/or current lives with that particular line from "Know Yourself" playing in the background.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While this usage on TikTok often falls under the common misinterpretation that Drake is talking about his problems when he says "woe," it's still worth noting and has produced some truly viral videos.</p><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">user</a> accompanied their video realization that someone they were previously with "had a twin-sized bed with one pillow," something they were clearly upset about. The video then transitions from them realizing to practically screaming it out (despite the audio being muted).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> sees a TikTok user reflecting on some charitable acts that she undertook; she raised $2 million for the nation of Australia when the country was being ravaged by wildfires in 2020 by selling nude photos of herself.</p><p>The user, like the previously mentioned video, reiterated that point at the song's climax, reflecting on and clearly in awe of her own actions.</p><p>As of now, the song has been used in roughly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1.3 million videos</a> on the app.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXafCr7rIp55mrJinvLazx2aroZ1da3q4tdOhZKaxXay8pr%2BMppyapg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-patrice-lovely-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Patrice Lovely Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-tried-mountain-dew-cookbook-recipe-it-looks-radioactive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Tried a Recipe and It Looks Radioactive</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
