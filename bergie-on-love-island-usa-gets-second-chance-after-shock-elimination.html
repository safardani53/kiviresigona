Luckily for us, we get to watch the drama and recouplings unfold on-screen, and Bergie is just one of the few bombshells joining this year’s cast. He was the first to be eliminated, but a shocking ‘second chance’ text hinted it’s not the end of his journey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/07/2023-07-19-15_33_49-First-Look_-Sparks-Fly-As-Islanders-Meet-Each-Other-for-the-First-Time-_-Love-Is.png><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-bergie-on-love-island>Meet Bergie on Love Island</h2><p>Bergie is a Love Island USA season 5 contestant. His mother passed away when he was four years old, and Bergie and his younger siblings Soren and Else stayed connected with the whole family.</p><p>Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen is a 23-year-old Dairy Queen manager. His Instagram bio states that he is “just a kid that makes ice cream and smiles for a living” and recently graduated from Dakota State University.</p><p>He graduated Magna Cum Laude with a 3.7 GPA while taking part in two honor societies, the National Society of Leadership and Success, as well as Tri-Beta (Biology Honor Society).</p><p>The islander also works as Dairy Queen’s General Night Manager and as a group fitness instructor. Next fall, Bergie is starting Physical Therapy school at the University of Mary in Bismarck North Dakota.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-season-5-star-gets-shock-elimination>Season 5 star gets shock elimination</h2><p>Love Island USA season 5’s Bergie received a shocking elimination that had his co-stars convinced he was about to be sent home after just one night in the villa. Bergie and&nbsp;his partner Anna Kurdys were made vulnerable.</p><p>It came after they were voted as having the least amount of chemistry. “I just felt I wouldn’t be able to fall asleep in an empty bed tonight without a guilty conscience,” Bergie said as he revealed he voted himself off and saved Anna.</p><p>Host Sarah Hyland told Anna and Bergie that they had to choose between themselves which one of them would leave the villa. Anna felt “heartbroken” and hugged her partner in tears, but he said it was not her fault.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bergie-gets-second-chance-text>Bergie gets ‘second chance’ text</h2><p>In a shocking twist, Bergie – once he was outside the villa with his packed bags – got a text that simply read, “Bergie, everyone deserves a second chance #still in the game #throupleup.”</p><p>Just before leaving, Bergie told his fellow islanders: “I’m going to be rooting for all of you guys. He also said it was a shock that he had to leave so early. “I wish I had more time in the villa for sure,” Bergie added.</p><p>Fans have been trying to get justice for the contestant following his shock exit, but luckily they are now applauding the producers for giving him a second chance. A viewer said, “JUSTICE 4 BERGIE ‼️ HE IS GETTING THAT SECOND CHANCE.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Carsten Bergersen (@bergielicious35)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH LOVE ISLAND USA ON PEACOCK TUESDAY TO SUNDAY AT 9 PM</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOm5yrn5maerC6jKWmr51dnsCtrc2dZK6rkWK0psDSZqqem5%2BjsW6vx5qlnJ1dlrO1sdFmqqGnk6B6prjIpqCnmaSevK8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-jensen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Jensen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-frank-iero-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Frank Iero Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
