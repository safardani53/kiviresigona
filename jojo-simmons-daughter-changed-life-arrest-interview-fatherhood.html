The entrepreneur and television personality is the proud father of a 2-year-old daughter, Mia, who he credits for transforming him into a completely different person from his past. “I had a lot of troubles, but me having a child matured me in a crazy way. It made me look at life way differently and just made me way more focused on things,” he tells the&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>podcast</a> EXCLUSIVELY, while promoting his hit WEtv show, Growing Up Hip Hop (learn more below). “Now, I don’t focus on things that don’t matter, or on people that don’t matter. So, I think me becoming a father really made me who I am today, and it’s the greatest thing in the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As you may recall, Simmons, the son of<strong> Run DMC</strong> founder <strong>Joseph Simmons</strong>, 53, was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>charged</a> with attempted reckless endangerment, criminal use of drug paraphernalia, resisting arrest and criminal possession of marijuana in 2009. — An incident he’s learned from and is aware of its severity. “Yeah, I was crazy, crazy rebellious,” he admits, adding that he “doesn’t miss” that world. “I’m still the same person. People are gonna be who they are. But, I love coming home to my daughter. I don’t, like to go to clubs or anything.” Now, his he follows a different routine. “I go to work and I come home and that’s what I do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Now, Jojo spends his days with his daughter, and his longtime girlfriend, <strong>Tanice Amira</strong>, as well as working on his businesses. Although he’s finished rapping, Jojo manages his his own record label and developing artists. He also started a lifestyle brand for fathers called Daddy Committee, which produces baby bags and other products for the daddy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As a father, “communication is the biggest thing in a relationship,” Jojo said of his relationship with Amira. He explained: “If you don’t know how to communicate, then you have nothing. If you can’t communicate, then you’re not connected; You’re not on the same level; You’re not on the same page, and if you’re not on the same page, you’re in a whole different book.” And, that right there, is the key to his romance, which his stronger than ever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jojo and his sister, <strong>Vanessa Simmons</strong>, visited <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>‘s New York City headquarters, where they talked family, relationships, business and their hit WEtv show, Growing Up Hip Hop! — Check out GUHH every Thursday at 9/8c!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH14e49vZqOnmqR6tLXMpqanq12Zrrazx62cq2WTna6vs8SdZKWhlpp6or7RnqqtZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGWWlsGpsdGhpqicXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./killer-outbreak-fears-child-dies-mysterious-illness.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Killer outbreak fears as child dies of 'mysterious' illness - and classmates treated</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-ditches-drake-amid-scrutiny-of-rappers-texts-to-tee.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did She DUMP Drake For Texting Teen Starlets?!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
