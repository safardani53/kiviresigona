Kraven is a beautiful character. Sergei Kravinov is a beautiful character because it’s someone who’s really understanding themselves and has flaws. This is a character that was built ages ago and it’s in a new time and era, but yeah, is he going to be the hunter that we all want to see? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely,” the actor said.</p><h2>Where and When To Watch</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11><i>Kraven the&nbsp;Hunter&nbsp;</i>will be released in theaters on October 6, 2023.
