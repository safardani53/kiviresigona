some new additions to the Kardashian Kloset website, where members of the famous family list their expensive clothes and accessories for sale.</p><p>The reality TV personality <a href=# aria-label="listed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">listed</a> a vintage <a href=#>Hermes bag</a>, which is rare according to the listing, on the page.</p><p>She is asking $29, 995 for the handbag, with an additional $14.95 charge for shipping.</p><p>According to the listing, the bag is black "but appearing espresso brown."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="More Kardashian News">More Kardashian News</h2><p>It's listed as in "fair condition," with the site noting that is "has sun fading" as well as "a spot on front, and has minor scratching on metal."</p><p>Kim has quite a collection of expensive handbags, including Birkins.</p><p>She was seen out on December 1 <a href=#>carrying a giant $250,000 crocodile Birkin</a> in New York City.</p><p>Haters slammed her over the accessory, with one joking: "That's the biggest Birkin I've ever seen."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HOLIDAY CHEER</h2><p>Kim isn't just taking heat over her bag collection either.</p><p>The Kardashians star is also facing backlash over her holiday decor.</p><p>She has given fans glimpses at the luxurious but minimalist displays on the grounds at her home.</p><p>Kim recorded her driveway, showing off <a href=#>trees lined with white lights</a>.</p><p>She has also shown off the bushes lining another part of her home, which are covered in similar decorations.</p><p>Inside is much the same with one exception: <a href=#>North West's room</a>.</p><p>The tween showed off her over-the-top festive bedroom on TikTok, sparking outrage from viewers.</p><p>North, 10, filmed a video on the account she shares with her mom, revealing nine Christmas trees and piles of gifts collecting around the area.</p><p>The holiday-themed video featured a sped-up version of Ariana Grande's Santa Tell Me.</p><p>It lasted 30 seconds with the camera panning around the room, which featured a sign that read: "North pole."</p><p>Early in the clip a pink-themed Christmas tree was shown.</p><p>It was decorated with ornate items and pink embellishments, including pink ornaments, pink bulbs, and pink ribbon.</p><p>There was also an Elf on the Shelf toy positioned near the tree.</p><p>The toy was wearing a pink and white outfit.</p><p>There were several Christmas presents wrapped in an all-white gift paper under the tree.</p><p>Next to the pink tree was a smaller white, silver and gold-decorated spruce tree.</p><p>It also had gifts under it – this time covered in silver wrapping.</p><p>A desk sitting between the trees was covered in fake snow, cookies for Santa, and tabletop ornaments.</p><p>Two large Christmas pines were raised on either side of North's bed.</p><p>They were decorated in traditional holiday colors.</p><p>On the bed were Santa and elf-shaped pillows.</p><p>There was also a plaid blanket laid overtop the comforter.</p><p>Another pair of Christmas trees was positioned on the other side of the room.</p><p>One featured an all-white color palette while the other was decorated in pink.</p><p>Each of those trees also featured a few gifts underneath.</p><p>Before the video came to a close, the camera captured a trio of Christmas stockings hung and spaced beneath a TV mounted on a wall in the room.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BASKETBALL BACKLASH</h2><p>Kim was further criticized on Wednesday after she was seen sitting <a href=#>courtside with her son</a> Saint at a Lakers game.</p><p>The basketball team was taking on the <a href=#>Phoenix Suns</a>.</p><p>The mogul and <a href=#>her eight-year-old</a> were at the game to celebrate his birthday.</p><p>He was seen wearing a No. 23 Lakers jersey – the number of <a href=#>LeBron James</a>.</p><p>Kim, for her part, wore an all-black outfit.</p><p>She had on a tight and low-cut top that pushed her cleavage together.</p><p>She was carrying a clutch in her hands as well.</p><p>The rhinestone-covered bag looked like a high heel.</p><p>Commenters on social media attacked the star for attending the game.</p><p>One particularly terse commenter wrote: "Kim Kardashian's stupid annoying a** being courtside looking bored as f**k is pissing me off.</p><p>"If you don’t&nbsp;cheer&nbsp;for the #Lakeshow right now ... Yes, I’m bitter."</p><p>Someone else slammed: "Kim Kardashian&nbsp;wasting them front row seats all in her d**n phone lol."</p><p>A third critiqued: "FYI: there is Kim Kardashian in the background texting&nbsp;while everyone else is freaking out at Anthony Davis‘s DUNK!!"</p><p>"Kim Kardashian, why are you even at the Lakers game? You’re missing out on the action. #GoHome," a fourth hater posted, including a photo of Kim on her phone.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Not everyone was unhappy to see Kim sitting courtside, however.</p><p>One supportive fan gushed: "KIM KARDASHIAN IS IN THE BUILDING."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/bag-kim-kardashian-selling-used-865017126.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/5705287-kim-kardashian-slammed-skittles-747833881-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kim-kardashian-jonathan-cheban-r-723007490.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGd%2Ben%2BQaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYsCmuMuipaBlpaiypXnBoqmkoZ5is62t1KeroqaXYsSmrcutn2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./montana-fishburne-chippy-d-sex-tape-released.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Montana Fishburne (Chippy D) Sex Tape Released</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./juan-manuel-guileras-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Juan Manuel Guileras Girlfriend: Who is Juan Manuel Guilera Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
