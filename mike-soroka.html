Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>History in the making, Mike Soroka will be the youngest opening pitcher for the Braves. Just 26-years old, the MLB player, Mike, was born in 1997.</p><p>Also, his birthdate falls on August 4, under the sun sign of Leo. Also, by birth, his full name is <strong>Michael John Graydon Soroka</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, the sign is known for being competent, passionate, and possessing leadership qualities. And looking at him, Soroka has all of those traits.</p><p>Despite being young, Soroka is already in his A-games and has more to offer. However, his tender age hugely contradicts his well-built physique. This superstar stands at 6 feet 5 inches(196 cm) and weighs around 99 kgs(218 lbs).&nbsp;</p><p>With that being said, other body measurements are unknown about this Canadian athlete.</p><p>Moreover, he has got short blonde hair and stunning blue hair. But don’t fall for his charm because this guy is known for 163 strikeouts under his name.</p><p>Likewise, Soroka belongs to Canadian nationality with White ethnicity. Unfortunately, the religion of Mike is unavailable at the moment.</p><h2>Mike Soroka- Family, Education, and Early Life</h2><p>Mike Soroka, whose full name is Michael John Graydon Soroka, was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He is the son of the father, <strong>Gary Soroka</strong>, and mother, <strong>Sally Soroka.</strong></p><p>Just like him, his father was also an athlete and played hockey for university and junior years. But the whereabouts of his mother are unknown at this moment.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexie Brown Age, Height, Parents, Israel, Salary, Jersey, Maryland, Net Worth >></a></p><p>Aside from his parents, there is no information or details regarding his siblings. But going through his Instagram, it seems he does have an older sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/young-mike-soroka.2-243x300.png><p>Nonetheless, Soroka completed his high school education at Bishop Carroll High School. As for his college, Mike enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;</p><p>However, during his early days, Soroka followed the path laid by his father and served as a goalie in youth hockey. Later, he derailed from hockey and focused solely on baseball.</p><h3>Mike Soroka Will Be The Youngest Opening-day Starter For the Braves</h3><p>On Tuesday, the Atlantic Braves announced that Mike Soroka would be making history as an opening-day starter against the Mets on <i>July 24</i>. Soroka, who is just 22, will be making history in the Braves.</p><p>Likewise, the outing will be at Citi Field, where he made his major-league debut in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Their manager,<strong><a href=#> Brian Snitker</a>,</strong> informed the young player on Monday after he pitched. And, of course, Soroka expressed his opinion regarding their news.</p><p>“It’s pretty cool. It’s a good feeling…When Snit told me, it was cool. It is something you dream about as a kid. Opening Day to me was always about watching the best pitchers who were available for each team. It is one of the only times of the year that you align all the best pitchers at once, and you get to pick your matchups.”</p><p>Moreover, manager Snitker also expressed his happiness over the history-making news.</p><p>“When I told him, you could tell he was excited. It’s a big deal, regardless of the situation. It’s an honor. It is a big deal and well-deserved. He understands what that means, and he’s worked hard. It’s well-deserved.”</p><p>Similarly, his first pitch will likely be against <a href=#><strong>Jacob deGrom</strong></a>, the Mets ace, the reigning two-time Cy Young winner.</p><p>Of course, Soroka talked fondly about the opponent. He even identified Jacob as the best pitcher in baseball.</p><p>“Arguably the best the last couple of years. He’s special to watch, and he’s special to compete with; I’ve gotten to do it a couple of times. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to face each other at the plate this time, so that’ll be a little change, but I’m excited nonetheless.”</p><h2>How Good Is Mike Soroka?- Professional Career</h2><p>After steering away from hockey, Mike pitched for the junior national team under Chris Reitsma’s guidance. He continued baseball in his college years at the University of Berkeley as well.</p><p>Before he went professional, Mike was ranked 88th in Baseball America’s annual rankings of prospects. Then in the 2015 Major League Basketball draft, the Atlanta Braves picked him 28th overall.</p><p>Likewise, Soroka was signed by the Braves, and then he reported to the GCL Braves. Before his reassignment to the Danville Braves, he posted a 1.80 ERA in ten innings.</p><p>Then Soroka spent the 2016 season with the Rome Braves and 2017 with the Mississippi Braves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mike-001.jpg><p>Moreover, Soroka participated in the All-Star Futures Games in July.

Mike faced New York Mets in his first game, pitched six innings, yielded one run, and recorded five strikeouts.</p><p>Sadly, the injury in his right shoulder placed him on the disabled list. On June 27, Soroka was transferred to the sixty-day disabled list and only made his return in August.</p><p>Soroka only registered five starts, a 2-1 record, 3.51 ERA, and 21 strikeouts with the injury and all. Unfortunately, the 2019 season did not start well for Soroka, as he disclosed shoulder discomfort and was off in January.</p><p>After all that, Mike finally made his season debut against the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 18, 2019. Not to mention, he also became the youngest pitcher in the National League.</p><p>Mike also set another record as the youngest Atlanta Braves pitcher to be named All-star. In addition, he was runner-up in NL Rookie of the Year and placed 6th in NL City Young Voting.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mike Soroka | Injury</h2><p>Although 2020 became a successful season for Soroka and his team, a piece of unexpected news spoiled all the happiness.</p><p>Mike suffered from an Achilles injury which led him underwent through surgery.
