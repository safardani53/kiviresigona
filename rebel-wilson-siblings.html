But honestly, her bizarre brand of humor never gets old.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And although she's had plenty of "sisters" as Amy in <a href=#>Pitch Perfect's</a> a cappella group — along with a brother when she played Brynn in Bridesmaids — plenty of fans have likely wondered about Rebel's family in real life.</p><p>So does the hilariously quirky actress with a phenomenal set of pipes have any siblings? Let's take a closer look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rebel Wilson has three siblings — all with similarly rebellious names.</h2><p>Rebel is the oldest of her siblings, and then there's her sister, Liberty, who was born two years later in 1982; her brother Ryot, who was born in 1988; and her sister, Annachi, who was born in 1992.</p><p>Annachi's real name is actually Annaleise, but she prefers to be called by the more on-theme-for-her-family moniker, which is similar to the word "anarchy."</p><p>Out of Rebel's three siblings, she seems to be the closest to her youngest sister. Annachi is often seen alongside her famous sister at movie premieres and other public events. Sometimes, they even work together!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>An <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2020 Instagram post</a> featured the siblings posing together on the set of a commercial. She captioned the snap with, "Wilson sisters crushing it on set! Can you guess who’s 11 years older?? Our second commercial together."</p><p>As for Rebel's other two siblings, Liberty and Ryot, they got a taste of the spotlight when they appeared together on The Amazing Race Australia in 2011.</p><p>"Our family has bred and shown beagles for five generations, and it's something I absolutely love to do," Liberty explained on the show.</p><p>"When she says, 'our family,' I'm completely excluded from this," Ryot clarified. "I'm a professional poker player. I play full time."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Of her brother, Liberty shared, "Ryot is very competitive. He's pretty intelligent. He's one of the most arrogant people I've come across," to which Ryot replied, "I would agree with that; I am intelligent."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Keeping with the family's theme when it comes to monikers, Rebel's sister, Liberty, has a daughter named Sovereign. (And yes, in case you were wondering: Rebel isn't just a stage name.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When Rebel shared the names of her siblings during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Craig Ferguson</a> in 2017, he responded by clarifying, "Rebel is not an assumed name, then, it's a given name?"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, that's my real name," the actress confirmed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Rebel Wilson and Owen Wilson related?</h2><p>Rebel and Owen have the same last name. They both have blond hair. And they're both actors. That must mean they're related, right?</p><p>Well, no. Wilson is a very common last name, and on top of that, even though Rebel Wilson is her real, legal name, Wilson is not the surname she was born with. Rebel Wilson was actually born Melanie Elizabeth Bownds.</p><p>Owen Wilson, on the other hand, was born Owen Cunningham Wilson. His family is from Dallas, Texas, and we all know Rebel grew up in Australia. While there are relatives who live in separate parts of the world, they weren't born with the same last name, and there is simply no proof that Owen Wilson and Rebel Wilson are related at all. We would like to see them in a movie together, though!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7KjsctmrqKko6S7br%2FIm6Oippeo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./selling-sunset-mary-fitzgerald-filed-bankruptcy-before-jason-real-estate-group.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Selling Sunset favorite Mary Fitzgerald filed for $139k bankruptcy before joining ex Jasons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-edward-sophie-christmas-card-photos-2023-8417994.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Edward and Sophie's Christmas Card Revealed!
