Glen Harris, her son, announced his mother’s death to The Hollywood Reporter:</p><p>“It is with deep regret and grief that I inform you that Estelle Harris died this evening at 6:25 p.m. Her compassion, passion, sensitivity, humor, empathy, and love were almost unparalleled, and she will be sorely missed by everyone who knew her.”</p><p>The actress was also said to have died of natural causes at her home in Palm Desert, California. Harris was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, although she previously told TMZ that doctors “took everything out.”&nbsp;In addition to her legendary performance in Seinfeld, Harris is most known for her portrayal as Mrs. Potato Head in the Toy Story trilogy.&nbsp;Tarzan II, Timon & Pumbaa, Dave the Barbarian, The Family Guy, Mickey Mouse Works, Home on the Range, Futurama, and Kim Possible have all featured her as a voice artist.</p><h2>A look at Estelle Harris’ Seinfeld character.</h2><p>In the popular American sitcom Seinfeld, Estelle Harris portrayed Estelle Costanza. Mrs. Costanza first appeared in the sitcom in the Emmy Award-winning episode The Contest in 1992. Mrs. Constanza was Frank Costanza’s demanding and stereotypical wife, as well as George Costanza’s mother. Throughout the six seasons, the character became recognized for her love-hate relationship with her husband Frank, as well as her regular tirades and scathing remarks directed towards her son George.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Estelle-Harris-2.jpeg alt="Estelle Harris" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 1998, Harris described Estelle Costanza as the “mother who everyone loves, while being a “pain in the neck.”&nbsp;In another old CTVN interview, Harris said that “nobody had a history” like Mrs. Costanza:</p><p>“I’m referring to that unfortunate lady.” She still lived in the same apartment they married in, with the same furnishings, the same husband, and one kid who was a loser. I mean, she had everything wrong with her! “I thought that was amusing.”</p><p>Harris also talked to The Canadian Press about her role in 2012, saying she enjoyed earning exposure from younger followers in recent years:</p><p>“In the past year or two, these kids have suddenly recognized me as Mrs. Costanza, Estelle Costanza. So we have a new age group, and I’m receiving a lot of fan letters from them as well. “I believe ‘Seinfeld,’ because of the script and the proper cast, will continue for many years.”</p><p>In the fourth season of Seinfeld, Estelle Harris was cast as Mrs. Costanza. Her last appearance as the character was in the show’s final episode, The Finale, in 1998.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Estelle-Harris-1.jpg alt="Estelle Harris" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter is mourning the death of Estelle Harris.</h2><p>Estelle Harris has nearly 100 acting credits from a career spanning more than four decades in cinema and television.
