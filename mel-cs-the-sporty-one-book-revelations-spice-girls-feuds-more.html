Their rise was fast and intense, with the singers parting ways for the first time in 1998.</p><p>In the early days, the bandmates — who were known as <a href=#>Sporty Spice (Chisolm), Posh Spice (Beckham), Ginger Spice (Halliwell), Scary Spice (Brown) and Baby Spice (Bunton)</a> — bonded over their fame.</p><p>“We loved going to Windsor at the weekends (once again taking our lives into our hands as Geri bombed along the M4). Often, Victoria would go home on a Friday night to see her boyfriend at the time, and Emma would head back to her mum in Finchley too,” Chisholm wrote. “But Geri, Mel B and I would drive over to Windsor on a Saturday where, for the very first time I had ‘posh’ ice cream; Häagen-Dazs had a store there and I ordered my inaugural Cookies & Cream. What a revelation!”</p><p>The musician, who shares daughter Scarlett, 13, with ex <strong>Thomas Starr</strong>, recalled thinking she and her bandmates were the “bee’s knees” when they started out. “When the five of us were together, we felt unstoppable,” she gushed.</p><p>Looking back, Chisholm revealed that <a href=#>she was “nervous” about becoming Sporty Spice</a>. That perception shifted when she made her 1999 solo album, Northern Star.</p><p>“I realized that, well, <a href=#>I am Sporty Spice</a>, she’s always in there. Two bars of ‘Wannabe’ and I’m jumping around like a knob. It’s not like I have to put on an act, it’s just there,” she revealed. “It was a huge weight lifted from me. After struggling to understand who I was throughout Northern Star, and beyond, <a href=#>I was now able to accept every aspect of myself</a>.”</p><p>When the group reunited in 2007 for a world tour, as well as the 2012 Olympics and their 2019 tour (<a href=#>sans Beckham</a>) — Chisholm finally understood how big the Spice Girls were to their fans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The main arc of our career was, pretty much, <a href=#>over and done in two years</a>. ‘Wannabe’ came out July 1996, Geri left in May 1998 and shortly after that [it all ended],” she wrote. “Rather than us fading into the distance and becoming some sort of nostalgic memory, we somehow managed to outpace even newer, bigger bands with this tour. … I think that speaks volumes, that we have a fanbase <a href=#>comparable to today’s biggest bands</a>.”</p><p>Scroll down for more of Chisholm’s revelations from The Sporty One: My Life as a Spice Girl:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqa4jJyqZqyYmnq0vM6rq7Jln6Oybq7OqKJmqpWrsq2t06Kmp6tdqL2qr8RmnqKqnKh6p7HUnapmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./international-delight-discontinues-coffee-creamer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Popular coffee cream maker discontinues fan favorite - customers are 'outraged' and hate its replace</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-steps-out-in-just-a-lacy-bodysuit-once-again-as-she-launches-jeans-range.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian steps out in just a lacy bodysuit once again as she launches jeans range</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
