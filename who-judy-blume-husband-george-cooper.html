Blume and Thomas A. Kitchens.</p><p>Cooper is an American <a href=#>film</a> producer known for his role on the set of the 2012 film, Tiger Eyes, and a former <a href=#>Columbia University</a> law professor.</p><p>Not much is known about Cooper's personal life because he often stays out of the spotlight, but fans got a glimpse at it in June 2021 when Blume announced that he had <a href=#>pancreatic cancer</a>.</p><p>In an <a aria-label="essay (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">essay</a> that was published on the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network website, Blume recalled the night she first noticed her <a href=#>husband's symptoms</a>, revealing that his entire body turned "seriously yellow."</p><p>"It was date night...When I came close for a cuddle and saw that he had turned yellow. I mean, seriously yellow. His face, his chest and arms, even the whites of his eyes," Blume recalled.</p><p>At the time, Cooper felt fine and insisted that nothing was wrong, but the famed child author didn't care, instead, she called the doctor and they quickly rushed to the ER.</p><p>"I called our local doctor and all the time George kept saying,&nbsp;'Tell him I’ll come in on Monday.' The doctor asked to speak to George. He told him this could be life threatening and he was to go to the ER right away. That got George’s attention," Blume continued.</p><p>The doctors at the ER didn't know what was wrong with him, so she called her cousin, a G.I. specialist at Baptist Hospital in <a href=#>Miami</a>, and then they headed there by ambulance.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"He had no fever. No&nbsp;symptoms&nbsp;other than painless&nbsp;jaundice, an expression we would hear a lot in the coming days," Blume said.</p><p>While at Baptist’s ER, they ran several tests and it was then revealed he had pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The news was shocking, but after undergoing a Whipple procedure and chemotherapy, Cooper became a pancreatic cancer survivor.</p><p>Six years prior to the diagnosis, he had <a href=#>prostate cancer</a> and Blume also battled early <a href=#>breast cancer</a>, she revealed.</p><h2>Do Judy and George have kids?</h2><p>During <a href=#>Blume's first marriage</a>, she welcomed two kids, a daughter <a href=#>Randy Lee Blume, and a son Lawrence Blume</a>.</p><p>Randy became a pilot and therapist while Lawrence joined the <a href=#>entertainment industry</a> as a filmmaker and entrepreneur.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/1984-ms-blume-author-controversial-811619534.jpg><p>Blume also has a stepdaughter, Amanda, from Cooper's previous relationship.</p><p>Despite being married for over 35 years, Blume and Cooper never had kids together.</p><h2>How many books has Judy Blume written?</h2><p>Since Blume started her writing career, she has written over 30 <a href=#>books</a> in the children's, young adult, and adult fiction genres.</p><p>She is arguably best known for The Fudge series, which includes the classics Superfudge, Fudge-a-mania, and Double Fudge, as well as Wifey, Summer Sisters, and In the Unlikely Event.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In April 2023, <a href=#>Prime Video</a> released the documentary <a href=# aria-label="Judy Blume Forever (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judy Blume Forever</a>, which takes a look at the impact her career has had on generations of young girls.</p><p>The film is available for streaming now with an active subscription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaWh9doKRaK6hp12fwqXFjJujrqWVYrW2v8GapZ1ll5q8s7PEZpqop6Cav3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peacock-streaming-service.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Peacock (streaming service) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teyana-taylor-is-insecure-about-body-cant-afford-to-lose-weight.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Teyana Taylor Is Insecure About Body: Cant Afford to Lose Weight</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
