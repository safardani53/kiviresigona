He shared that he was bringing out his father, Travis Barker, and Hossler as his guest performers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The duo seemed close, with Hossler often gushing about his friend’s rockstar father helping him out a few times.</p><p>For those out of the loop, Hossler is signed to the former Blink 182 member’s record label, and they have been working together.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Just Jared</a>, the aspiring musician revealed the older Barker stepped in when he had a falling out with his father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“We had a falling out with my dad a little this past year, and [Travis] really stepped in, in a way that I needed. He overstepped nothing and wasn’t trying to weasel his way in. He was there when I needed him,” said Hossler.</p><p>The singer added that the drummer loved him and treated him like his son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRmbKveceoqqyklad6pLTEmqtmppWowKJ5wZqpq52kqXupwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-bosa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Bosa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-obrien-theatre-rocky-horror-show-musical.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I consider myself 70 per cent male - my wife says it's more like 50:50, says Rocky Horror Show creat</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
