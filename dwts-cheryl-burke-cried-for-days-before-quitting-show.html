I have made the final decision," the San Francisco native said on November 20.&nbsp;</p><p>"Woah, it really, I guess, on top of my divorce, this has been a different type of divorce. This has been a relationship I would kind of compare it to- a relationship that has had a lot of ups and downs."</p><p>Cheryl, 38, revealed that behind the scenes "it has been really sad" and that there were even "waterworks" and she started crying her&nbsp;"eyes out."</p><h2>DIVORCE 2.0</h2><p>Cheryl and her ex, Matthew Lawrence, <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in February after nearly three years of marriage,&nbsp;noting irreconcilable differences caused their split a month prior.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Their divorce was finalized on September 19, the same day of the <a href=#>season 31 DWTS</a> premiere.</p><p>"Breaking up with DWTS was like divorce all over for her," the source said.</p><p>"Her divorce had a lot to do with her needing a break. The divorce took a toll on her mental health so she's really going to be taking this time to focus on herself and figuring out what's next."</p><p>Cheryl has been a big advocacy of mental health and has said that she'd like to continue on her journey of getting "the messaging out that mental health is important."</p><h2>NEW CHAPTER</h2><p>She soon might even be addressing the importance of mental health on a larger scale.</p><p>"There's a lot of talk about me being a part of another television show. Stay tuned for that. It is definitely about mental health," she teased.</p><p>In the meantime, the ballroom dancer will be continuing her podcast and working on some other projects, which she has yet to announce.</p><p>She shared with her Instagram followers, "I am excited about the idea of evolving, about being challenged in new ways, having the ability to expand my commitment to mental health advocacy, focusing on my new found love for podcasting, & I’m ready to face the uncertainty (though it’s scary as sh**) of what the future holds - I do have a few things up my sleeves though, so don’t worry."</p><p>As far as whether she'll be getting back into the dating game post DWTS, the source revealed, "She does want to start dating again but it's been a slow process.</p><p>"She's been focused on DWTS so now that it's over, she can take that time to go on dates.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's not a huge rush for her, but yes she'd like to meet someone she's head over heels for and fall in love again."</p><h2>POSSIBLE RETURN</h2><p>Cheryl performed a Samba routine with her "favorite" partners <a href=#>Louis Van Amstel</a> and <a href=#>Pasha Pashkov</a> during Monday's night's finale- ahead of <a href=#>Charli D'Amelio</a> and <a href=#>Mark Ballas winning</a> the Mirror Ball trophy.&nbsp;</p><p>They danced to Barry Manilow's "Copacabana," in which Cheryl dedicated the dance to everyone who has supported her during her career on <a href=#>the Disney+ show</a>.</p><p>"It's been an amazing chapter. It has changed my life completely," she said on her podcast.</p><p>"It has made me the woman I am today. I'd like to say the&nbsp;woman I am yet to become is not with this family, though it's all bitter sweet."</p><p>The season 31 finale also marked the last episode of <a href=#>Len Goodman's</a> position as lead judge.</p><p>He <a href=#>announced his retirement</a> during the November 14 episode.</p><p>As far as whether Cheryl will be <a href=#>replacing Len</a> next season, the source said that <a href=#>her return as a judge</a> or guest judge is "up in the air."</p><p>"Casting doesn't make those decisions until weeks prior to the start of next season," the source told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>"At that point, I'm sure she'll be missing the family and want to be part of the show in some way but right now, she's content with her decision and wants to see what these next few months are like."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Cheryl even said herself on her podcast that she doesn't know if she will fill Len's spot, but that thinking that far ahead "really is scary."</p><p>"I have a lot of fear behind this decision.
