The Maryland region was already under a flood and tornado warning, so the organizers anticipated a temporary delay in the concert. The concert was eventually canceled owing to the circumstances becoming intolerable. Excited Halsey fans had already crowded the Merriweather Post Pavilion well before the event started, causing an utter commotion as the rain unexpectedly swamped the whole stadium.</p><p dir=ltr lang=und><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D4cOlEkSqK</a></p><p>— Ben Kelkis (@Bennyokay_) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2022</a></p><h2>“I don’t even know what to say,” a broken-hearted Halsey writes about the incident.</h2><p>The bleachers at the location where the show was planned were flooded. Fans waited in vain for the artist, who was supposed to arrive at 7 p.m. However, bad weather prompted a postponement and, eventually, cancellation of the program.&nbsp;Following the uproar, Halsey addressed her fans, saying she wanted to perform “more than anything” that night.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Halsey-2.jpg alt=Halsey width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She also states in a series of tweets how she is aware and dismayed that the venue was unable to manage the issue and that her event would now be held elsewhere. She stated:</p><p>“I’d want to add that I am quite upset with how the venue handled things tonight, and my rescheduled date will take place someplace else. I guarantee I hear you loud and clear.”</p><h2>Fans post footage from the flooded arena.</h2><p>As the event was postponed due to inclement weather, footage from inside the venue showed floods rushing across the audience.&nbsp;In other films, a team member is seen kicking a squirrel. This event also irritated many individuals. It can be seen how the squirrel was attempting to escape the ankle-high waters but was brutally kicked by a member of Halsey’s staff on stage.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#VIDEO</a>: Heavy rain sent water gushing at Merriweather Post Pavilion.

The situation worsened when the hall was packed with disappointed supporters who had to leave.&nbsp;While some fans praised the performer’s gesture of rescheduling and prioritizing the safety of her followers, others demanded a refund.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Halsey-3.jpg alt=Halsey width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The venue’s seating capacity was 19,000, and the amphitheater was completely full. Some fans traveled long distances, while others crossed the border. As a result, incidents like these dampen the morale of the supporters.&nbsp;Halsey subsequently went live on Instagram to discuss the matter with her followers.&nbsp;She also noted in the Instagram live session that she was in contact with meteorological experts, but the terrible weather was beyond of her control. She also announced that the performance will be rescheduled at another site; more information would be revealed by the team shortly.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Halsey</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqSjmsZuv8eormafn6l6pK3NnJylnZRirqfAxKtkraCVYq6uvMeiq6Gdkamys3nFpaaonJWZfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teacher-quits-students-find-side-hustle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I was forced to quit teaching after students found my side hustle - I don't care, I'll do anything t</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./estelle-harris-passed-away-at-the-age-of-93.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Estelle Harris Passed Away At The Age Of 93</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
