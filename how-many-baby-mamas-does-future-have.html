Future first hit the music scene as a songwriter for fellow Atlanta-based artists, one of the biggest being Ludacris.</p><p>His big break came in 2011 when he wrote the song "Racks" for YC. The song was a major bop and got the attention of everyone in the music scene. Since then, he's worked with everyone from Drake to Gucci Mane and Lil Wayne.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But sometimes it's his personal life that has people talking the most. And with Brittni Mealy — one of his baby mamas — calling him out on Instagram, it has left the public asking questions about his family life.

Future currently has eight children with eight different women.</p><p>Jessica Smith, Brittni Mealy, India J, singer Ciara, professional dancer Joie Chavis, Eliza Seraphin, Cindy Parker, and one woman who has chosen to not be identified are the mothers of Future's children.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Future was previously engaged to Ciara, but the two broke up three months after they welcomed Future Jr., his fourth child.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Future and Brittni Mealy recently got into an argument on social media.</h2><p>On August 10, 2021, Brittni revealed a few screenshots on Instagram that show Future allegedly telling their 8-year-old son — Prince Wilburn — that his mother should buy him clothes and calling Brittni a "ho."</p><p>Brittni proceeded to blast him in a slew of posts via Instagram stories.</p><p>"He [Future] texts this to a child. You're a real coward. He's 8 years old stupid," Brittni wrote in a now-deleted post.</p><p>Future chimed in to say that the messages are false, and Brittni further unleashed her wrath.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“Definitely not cap," Brittni wrote. "TF I got to lie for, you said it. It's definitely your number and his son, so stand on it and pipe down if you don’t want these recordings posted."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brittni claimed that the reason that Future is acting out is that she's no longer having sexual relations with him. The 31-year-old also shared that she will always "stand up for her children."</p><p>Things got worse once the "Life Is Good" MC posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptic tweet</a> with the message, "Pray for her." Future's mother also got in on the action to verbally attack Brittni on Instagram.</p><p>Brittni called out Future's mother, saying that "she is a part of the problem." She also said that she needs to stay out of his business and blamed her for raising a narcissist.

In May 2020, Eliza's lawyer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a> a DNA test proved Future was the father.</p><p>Eliza sued Future for paternity, child support, and custody of their child.

However, it seems she's recently dropped the case looking into his paternity, since she was unable to serve Future with legal papers — per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blast.</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After Cindy was finally able to serve Future legal papers</a>, the case moved forward. But in March 2020, Cindy dropped the case without much reason as to why.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Social media speculated that Future may have decided to acknowledge Cindy's child as his and that's the reason she dropped the case in court.</p><p>Not to mention, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blast</a> reports that Cindy and Eliza had their children take paternity tests. They later revealed in a now-deleted Instagram post that there is a 99.9 percent probability of their children being half-siblings. However, given that Future left Cindy out of his many Mother's Day shoutouts in May 2020, there's no way to confirm what's going on there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJlkpavunnMmqSaq12ZvKa%2FjJ%2Bsra2imnqprdWe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-wiese-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside David Wiese and Wife Chene Wieses Married Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hogan-molthan-19991221-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hogan Molthan (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
