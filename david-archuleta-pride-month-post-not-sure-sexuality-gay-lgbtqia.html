"I like to keep to myself but also thought this was important to share because I know so many other people from religious upbringings feel the same way," he shared in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>caption</a> of an Instagram selfie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've been open to myself and my close family for some years now that I am not sure about my own sexuality," Archuleta continued. "I came out in 2014 as gay to my family. But then I had similar feelings for both genders so maybe a spectrum of bisexual. Then I also have learned I don't have too much sexual desires and urges as most people, which works I guess because I have a commitment to save myself until marriage. Which people call asexual when they don't experience sexual urges."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He urged his 383K Instagram followers to be more compassionate to those "wrestling to follow their beliefs," something he admits he's struggled with. "Idk what to make of it and I don't have all the answers," Archuleta wrote. "I just invite you to please consider making room to be more understanding and compassionate to those who are LGBTQIA+, and those who are a part of that community and trying to find that balance with their faith which also is a huge part of their identity like myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we can do better as people of faith and Christians, including Latter-day Saints, to listen more to the wrestle between being LGBTQIA+ and a person of faith," he added. "There are more than you may realize going through that wrestle after all the misunderstandings that come with it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Archuleta went on to tell those in similar situations, "you're not alone. You can be part of the LGBTQIA+ community and still believe in God and His gospel plan..."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've tried for almost 20 years to try and change myself until I realized God made me how I am for a purpose," he continued his statement in the comments. "And instead of hating what I have considered wrong I need to see why God loved me for who I am and that it's not just sexuality."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Therapy Sessions artist debuted on American Idol in 2008 before taking a two-year hiatus from music in 2012 to go on a mission trip to Rancuagua, Chile, for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). "When I went on my mission, it kind of gave me a step away from everything, and I was able to grow up a little bit, on my own, without everyone watching me," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a> to The Salt Lake Tribune in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Maybe there are other people out there who are having a hard time finding their worth, feeling like they're good enough, and I can tell them a little bit about my challenge with those insecurities, and finding a purpose in spirituality," Archuleta added. "I dared to not be afraid to be a Mormon in the entertainment industry."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: David Archuleta Thinks About Joining the Idol Judges Table</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The LDS Church <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>has long opposed same-sex marriage and homosexual activity</a>. "The experience of same-sex attraction is a complex reality for many people," their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>website</a> states. "The attraction itself is not a sin, but acting on it is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Members of the church that act on same-sex attraction are considered to have violated their teachings on morality and are subject to "ecclesiastical discipline." Although the LDS Church previously taught that same-sex attraction is a curable condition, it now maintains that conversion therapy is "unethical."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjp2Yr6GUYq6zr8euo56skWK9s7XDnmSmp56ptW68zqyrZqafqXq0wdGeZKydqKqurbXTsmSgmaliuaiu06qgmmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaelin-clay.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kaelin Clay</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./caught-wife-films-husband-in-his-underwear-showing-dog-how-to-da.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>CAUGHT!
