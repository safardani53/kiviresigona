Between roles in cult classics such as Body Heat, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Children of a Lesser God, and Broadcast News, William endeared himself to a generation in more ways than one.</p><p>Unfortunately, the veteran star has passed away at 71 years old, leaving behind a legacy that will surely endure for long after the dust settles from his saddening loss.

Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, the star was married to Mary Beth Hurt from 1971 to 1982. However, he and Sandra Jennings began a relationship in 1981, while William was still legally married to Mary.</p><p>Sandra became pregnant with William's child in 1982, which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, causing William and Mary to split. At that time, William and Sandra relocated to South Carolina due to its recognition of common-law marriages, which basically means that the state will honor their union even without the proper legal paperwork. The two never officially wed and later split, with Sandra suing William in New York court, hoping for their marriage to be recognized.</p><p>The courts ended up siding with William and saying that no legal marriage ever occurred, and that was the end of his and Sandra's relationship. After that, he dated Marlee Matlin for one year and they cohabited for the two years following.</p><p>Throughout his life, William had four children: Jeanna Bonnaire-Hurt, Samuel Hurt, Alexander Devon Hurt, and William Hurt.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was William Hurt's cause of death?</h2><p>William's death was revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> by his son, Will, on March 13, 2022.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheRichest</a> has estimated that his net worth was around $15 million.
