That’s disrespectful,” the “Sexy Can I” singer’s former manager said at the time, stating that he would “gift” the footage to either his former client or Kardashian’s ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>.</p><p>“The claim that there is an <a href=#>unreleased sex tape</a> is unequivocally false,” Kim’s attorney <strong>Marty Singer</strong> said in a statement to Us Weekly at the time. “It is unfortunate that people make these statements to try and get their 15 minutes of fame.”</p><p>Ray J echoed those sentiments, saying Wack 100’s claims were “not cool” and upset him. “How can I show growth and maturity if this kinda of stuff keeps happening?” he wrote via Instagram in September 2021. “I’m a father now and my job is to be a great parent and put them first. This is not the message I want to send out – smh.”</p><p>In January 2022, however, West revealed during an interview with Hollywood Unlocked‘s <strong>Jason Lee</strong> that <a href=#>he had personally retrieved the footage</a> and kept an alleged second tape from going public. “I went and got the laptop from Ray J myself that night,” the Yeezy designer recalled. “I met this man at the airport, then got on a red-eye, came back [and] delivered it to her at 8 a.m. in the morning.”</p><p>He continued: “<a href=#>[Kim] cried when she saw it</a>. You know why she cried when she seen it on the laptop? Because it represents how much she’s been used. It represents how much people didn’t love her and they just saw her as a commodity.” Ray J seemingly replied at the time via Twitter, writing, “This needs to stop. I also have kids.” (He shares Melody and Epic with <a href=#><strong>Princess Love</strong></a>. Kardashian and West, meanwhile, share daughters <a href=#>North and Chicago and sons Saint and Psalm</a>.)</p><p>Though she didn’t comment on West’s claims at the time, the KKW Beauty founder revealed that she learned about the threat of new sex tape footage being released <a href=#>while her son Saint was playing Roblox on his iPad</a>. “I can’t believe this is happening right now,” Kardashian said in an April 2022 episode of Hulu’s <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>, after seeing the “super inappropriate” popup that her son came across online. The subsequent two installments chronicled her attempt to regain control of the footage, including the <a href=#>emotional moment when West gifted her with the computers</a> and hard drives that contained the alleged sex tape.</p><p>“All of this is a lie smh,” Ray J <a href=#>commented on a Hollywood Unlocked Instagram post</a> that included a clip from The Kardashians. “Can’t let them do this anymore – so untrue.” The Love & Hip Hop Hollywood alum claimed that his meeting with the “Ultralight Beam” rapper didn’t happen <a href=#>the way it was explained on the show</a> and accused his ex-girlfriend and her mother, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, of twisting the story to make him look worse.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve sat in the shadows for over 14 years allowing the Kardashians to use my name, to abuse my name, make billions of dollars over a decade and a half talking about a topic I’ve never really spoken about,” Ray J told The Daily Mail in May 2022. “<a href=#>I’ve never leaked anything</a>. I have never leaked a sex tape in my life. It has never been a leak.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out everything Kardashian and Ray J have said about the drama surrounding their sex tape:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mqZqxXZ96tLHXZquaqJVisbOtzJpknq6Vp8a1tMinnmasmJrGt7GMrJiinF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-hating-game-movie-adaptation-everything-to-know-so-far.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Hating Game Movie Adaptation: Everything to Know So Far</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-do-alligator-hunters-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Do Alligator Hunters Make on the Show 'Swamp People'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
