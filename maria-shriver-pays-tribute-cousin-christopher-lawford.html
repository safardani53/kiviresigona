He passed away suddenly yesterday. He was my age, full of love and very much alive.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It took me a bit to think about how best to share about him and I do believe he would want me to share about him,” she continued. “He lived a big life and he cared deeply about life. He fought for his and in turn he fought to help so many people dealing with addiction issues. He was really at the forefront of the recovery movement, using his own story to save others, to help them feel less alone. I was always in awe of his courage, his bravery and his honesty.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lawford used LSD and heroin until the mid-1980s. In 1980, he was arrested for impersonating a doctor to secure prescription medication. The charges were dropped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lawford, who said he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was motivated to get clean</a> after cousin <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>David Kennedy</a>‘s fatal drug overdose, became a recovery advocate and wrote books such as When Your Partner Has an Addiction: How Compassion Can Transform Your Relationship (And Heal You Both in the Process). He was also known for his roles in shows like General Hospital, All My Children and Frasier, and movies like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shriver added, “We had dinner last week and he was so happy, proud of his kids, proud of his family, proud that he was where he was in his life. I told him I loved him, that I was proud of him, that I was so blessed to have him in my life, as he has been a witness to my whole life and I to his.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s been written that he was an actor and a Kennedy but he was so much more than that,” she continued. “He carved out his own life and those who knew him, who were helped by him, who read his books, who heard him speak, knew he was his own man.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shriver said, “He was Christopher Kennedy Lawford… Father, husband, brother, cousin, sponsor, advocate, healer, lover and warrior. Today may you honor those who have been with you for the long haul, those who know every part of you and who love you anyway, those who have stood in the storm and survived, and those fighting for their sobriety. Tell them you love them that you see them and believe in them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Bush Hager</a>, a daughter of a different political dynasty, commented on Shriver’s post, “This is beautiful.
