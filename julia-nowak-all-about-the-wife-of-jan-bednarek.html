In an interview, Nowak stated that it was Bednarek who penned her first Instagram post.&nbsp;She didn’t respond to him at first. However, Bednarek’s continual hilarious videos and messages, as well as his sense of humor and cleverness, compelled her to get to know him more.&nbsp;As a result, she accepted his offer to the match between Poland and Kazakhstan.</p><p>It was her first time in the stands since she had never been interested in football.&nbsp;She first saw him live during the Poland-Kazakhstan match, but before that, she met his managers, then his parents, and finally him.&nbsp;It immediately grabbed her interest, and they both recognized they were destined to be together, Nowak said in an interview.&nbsp;The pair got engaged on the Greek island of Mykonos in July 2020. On August 9, 2021, they had their first child, a daughter Lily.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Julia-Nowak-1.jpg alt="Julia Nowak" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Got married away from the press.</h2><p>After five years of courtship away from the limelight, the pair married on June 16, 2022, in Corpus Christi in front of friends and family.&nbsp;The wedding was nothing short of magical. Patrycja Kujawa, the designer of her exquisite wedding gown, created it.&nbsp;Julia’s photo in her gown was released on Instagram by the designer.</p><p>Her hair was fashioned by stylist Kajetan Gora, who was the first to announce the couple’s big day, revealing his joy about the preparations.&nbsp;Magda Pieczonaka, a well-known Polish make-up artist, performed her makeup.&nbsp;In one of the photographs provided by Bednarek’s friend Karol Linetta, the pair looked stunning, while Nowak was wearing another bridal gown.</p><h2>They have a healthy connection.</h2><p>In an interview, Nowak said that everyone who knows her and Bednarek have a balanced relationship in which they both agree on many topics, but they are both Aries, and no one is permitted to reign over them.&nbsp;She believes that in each relationship, one person compromises more than the other. According to her, she wanted to study and live a student life, but this did not occur.</p><p>She is now doing extramural studies and is pleased to be able to assist Bednarek. She claims she has no remorse about abandoning her ambitions.&nbsp;If she has to fly to Poland for a picture shoot, she does so. Everything may be resolved if you wish, she adds.&nbsp;In the same interview, she discussed how she told Bednarek about her pregnancy.&nbsp;According to Nowak, she took a pregnancy test when Covid-19 shut down everything in England.&nbsp;Bednarek was at the game at the time, and when he returned, she couldn’t express herself directly due to the feelings she was experiencing.&nbsp;As a result, she invited him to the living room, suggesting there was a surprise waiting for him, and when he saw the lines, he was overjoyed, she said.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Julia-Nowak-2.jpg alt="Julia Nowak" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Her net worth is still being calculated.
