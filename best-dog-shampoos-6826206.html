It calls on coconut-based cleansers to carefully clean, while ingredients like vitamin E and allantoin help soothe, moisturize, and condition your pup's skin and coat. The mild yet effective formula is hypoallergenic, pH-balanced, and unscented to minimize skin and eye irritation. It's also free of dyes, sulfates, and parabens.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This universal pet shampoo is gentle enough for dogs of all breeds, sizes, and ages — even puppies. It’s a favorite of Senior Tail Waggers veterinarian Sara Ochoa, DVM, for its sensitivity.&nbsp; “This is great for dogs with allergies and skin infections,” she says, including bacterial infections. She adds that if your dog has dry, flaky skin, it can also help moisturize it, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Allergies and sensitive skin are very different conditions,” clarifies Senior Tail Waggers veterinarian director Jamie Whittenburg, DVM tells PEOPLE. She cautions a shampoo alone will generally not cure allergies, since many are caused by environmental factors and food. That said, it can “soothe irritated skin and may aid in reducing the allergen load in the fur.” It's also worth nothing that it won't wash away any of the treatments. Considering the low price and gentle formula, this option is as good as they come (unless you really want a scented shampoo).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Amount: </strong>16 ounces | <strong>Scent:</strong> Unscented | <strong>Intended Use:</strong> Dogs and cats, all breeds and ages</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-arm--hammer-super-deodorizing-shampoo-for-dogs></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Arm & Hammer Shampoo for Dogs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Arm &amp;amp; Hammer Super Deodorizing Shampoo for Dogs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/859Eo6lOQlEKC_N8IV9FlKD2A-k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/arm-hammer-super-deodorizing-shampoo-for-dogs-f3dd245e281f4dae95e76cb5821b2beb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Arm & Hammer's Super Deodorizing Shampoo will offer the most bang for your buck. Like all of the brand's products, it's formulated with baking soda, a known odor absorber that helps your pooch smell fresh and clean. The fruity-floral scent doesn't hurt, either. This pH-balanced pet wash is easy on sensitive skin and gentle enough for both adult dogs and puppies. While it doesn't tackle specific issues like itching or shedding, it's a great option for your pet's regular bath routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Amount: </strong>20 ounces | <strong>Scent: </strong>Kiwi blossom |<strong> Intended Use: </strong>Adult dogs and puppies</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-ouai-fur-bb-pet-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ouai Fur Bébé Pet Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OUAI Pet Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3lFH9NSV5SBOSJ4OfD7PiJIp_VU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ouai-pet-shampoo-f292ed3ef1ef4e37ba6d1b98a9790c6f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are you open to spending a little extra to treat your pooch — and maybe yourself too? We highly recommend Ouai Fur Bébé. This fancy pet shampoo promises to gently cleanse without stripping, leaving the skin and coat soft and hydrated. With soothing aloe vera and neutralizing vinegar, it also helps keep irritation and odors at bay. But the best part might be the brand's signature scent, with a citrus base, floral notes, and a hint of musk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Amount:</strong> 16 ounces | <strong>Scent: </strong>Citrus-flora-musk | <strong>Intended Use:</strong> Dogs and cats</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-puppies-john-paul-pet-tearless-shampoo-for-puppies--kittens></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Puppies</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>John Paul Shampoo for Puppies & Kittens</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="John Paul Pet Tearless Shampoo for Puppies &amp;amp; Kittens" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AIwRpXRF4d54OdguUoFIQr5dUNw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/john-paul-pet-tearless-shampoo-for-puppies-kittens-51f0abd416bc4827ad37b802538f9c8a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">John Paul Pet Tearless Shampoo is the best option for puppies.

The soap-free formula is a two-in-one blend of shampoo and conditioner that lathers nicely, then rinses entirely clean. It leans on natural conditioners and calming ingredients, like aloe vera, green tea, and chamomile, while wheat protein tackles odors. The result?

Also, while this shampoo is suitable for adult dogs of all breeds, it's not recommended for puppies.

Instead, it leaves a citrus or plum-hibiscus scent in its wake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Amount: </strong>16 ounces | <strong>Scent: </strong>Citrus, plum-hibiscus | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>All dog breeds</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fleas-adams-plus-flea--tick-shampoo-with-precor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Fleas</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Adams Plus Flea & Tick Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Adams Plus Flea &amp;amp; Tick Shampoo with Precor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/DbeTUb26aj_JDfmk2Fo-vPCdiBU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/adams-plus-flea--tick-shampoo-ddd7578443df4a0d86ae496ac04cb305.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Since it’s medicated, we don’t recommend this as a regular shampoo, and it’s not intended for pets under the age of 12 weeks.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can have the cleanest environment possible around your dog and still not be able to control whether your dog gets fleas — but fear not, you can treat these pesky itch-inducers with medicated dog shampoo like Adams Plus Flea and Tick Shampoo.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If your dog has fleas and ticks this is a great shampoo that can help,” says Dr. Ochoa. “While many times your dog may also need flea and tick medications, this can be used for small dogs and kittens who are not yet old enough for the medications."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there are several hard-to-pronounce ingredients designed to kill fleas and flea eggs, this shampoo is actually quite gentle on dogs (even those with sensitive skin) and includes soothing aloe, oatmeal, and coconut extract.

So the less you wash them, the cleaner their fur will look and stay (short of getting super muddy, then it’s bath time!).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, when it’s time to bathe your dog, Dr. Lisa designed a line of products that are super gentle on your pet and made from all plant-derived and vegan ingredients like lavender oil, aloe vera, chamomile extract, coconut oil, and more — so they will soothe your dog’s skin rather than cause irritation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The shampoo comes in a sleek minimalist bottle that looks good on any shower shelf. While it’s a bit pricey, you’re paying for a cleaner formula (in addition to being a celebrity line of products) that will last you a long time. “I’ve also used this shampoo on my dog and it’s lasted a while because I only bathe her once or twice a month,” says Yauger. “You can definitely smell the lavender and chamomile notes, which I love because it makes me feel like I’m giving my dog a spa bath, but the natural fragrance might be too much for those who prefer unscented products.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Amount:</strong> 16.9 fl oz./ 500 ml | <strong>Scent:</strong> Lavender and chamomile | <strong>Intended Use:</strong> For dogs and puppies</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-rocco--roxie-calm-sensitive-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rocco & Roxie Calm Sensitive Skin</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rocco and Roxie Calm Sensitive Skin Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UEVaFcurxdgRs2hPQfDvDOcvK4c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rocco-and-roxie-calm-sensitive-skin-shampoo-4b5ab331eeee4521a1d3dfff198c9054.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This calming dog shampoo is one of the most gentle formulas we’ve come across. It’s infused with a ton of soothing ingredients like rosemary, chamomile, and aloe vera to moisturize your pup’s coat, stimulate collagen production, and calm any irritation. The shampoo also doesn’t have any common irritants like parabens, alcohol, dyes, or artificial colors. You’ll definitely notice a botanical scent of rosemary and chamomile, but it’s all natural from the included ingredients, so it won’t cause any upset like an artificial fragrance might.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rocco & Roxie is also a small, family-owned business and part of their guarantee is if your dog has any issues with this shampoo, or if it doesn’t work for their sensitive skin, you can send it back and get a full refund.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Amount:</strong> 16 fl ounces | <strong>Scent:</strong> Rosemary and chamomile | <strong>Intended Use:</strong> For puppies and dogs with sensitive skin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-dog-shampoo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Dog Shampoo</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Go With a Gentle Formula<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Finn, gentle formulas are ideal for dogs of all shapes, sizes, and breeds. Gentle shampoo prevents irritation or allergic reactions. "For general cleaning and removing things like pollen, dirt, and debris, I would recommend a soothing and non-medicated product," he says.

For other skin issues, look for helpful ingredients in the formula. "For a dog who has a mild skin infection with yeast or bacteria — and more than likely a more pungent smell — I would recommend a product that contains antimicrobial and antifungal properties," says Dr. Finn. And, of course, always speak to your vet: "Your best bet is to speak with your veterinarian about which shampoo is best for your pet if you believe your dog has any skin concerns,” Zoetis veterinarian Heather Berst, VMD tells PEOPLE.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Check the Intended Use<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many shampoos are intended for adult dogs only, while others are specifically formulated for the more delicate skin and sensitive eyes of puppies.

It varies among groomers, but yours might use a conditioning formula like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Buddy Wash</a> or a deodorizer like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Wahl Shampoo</a>.</p><p>That said, the other half of the grooming process, which leads to a silky coat, is brushing your dog’s hair. “Be sure to brush your dog’s coat before the bath to get out any hair mats or excess dirt,” says Dr. Berst.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What shampoo do vets recommend?</span></p><p>"The biggest deal to me is to use a pet-safe shampoo," says Dr. Finn. In other words, don't use your personal shampoo or whatever soap you have lying around at home. Dr. Finn also tends to go with gentle formulas. "I am a huge fan of veterinary-founded pet product companies," he adds.

She explains that dogs’ skin is more sensitive than ours and “overbathing can cause it to dry out and cause irritation.” If you want a refresh between baths though, she recommends pet wipes.&nbsp;</p><p>For pets with skin infections, Dr. Finn sometimes recommends an every-other-day bath routine for up to three weeks. "On the other hand, some dogs may only need to be bathed once or twice a year, and of course, many dogs fall somewhere in between."</p><p>So the general recommendation is to ask your vet about your specific dog, since there are no hard and fast rules with dog bathes.<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word for It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Theresa Holland</a> is a freelance commerce writer specializing in skincare, haircare, and lifestyle.
