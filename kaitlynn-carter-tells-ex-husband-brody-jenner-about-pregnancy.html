He’d hoped to be one of the “top 10 people” to find out. “A baby was such a big part of our relationship,” he explained.</p><p>Carter later decided to “be an adult” and “meet this had on,” pulling her ex aside to talk.</p><p>“You are an important person in my life and it’s not like you have to hang out all the time, but I want there to be a harmony,” the expectant star said. When Jenner asked whether she had a surprise for him, Carter said that she was pregnant. The Princes of Malibu alum’s reaction will appear on the Wednesday, August 4, episode of the MTV show.</p><p>Carter announced last month that she and <strong>Kristopher Brock</strong> are <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a>, his second. The couple were “on the same page” about having kids early in their relationship and decided to “go for it,” she said during a “HillsCast” podcast episode in June.</p><p>“<a href=#>It’s something that I wanted for so long</a>,” Carter added at the time. “When I found out I actually was pregnant, I was really surprised — in a good way, of course. But it took me a while to really absorb it. I’m just really excited now.”</p><p>Since she and Jenner <a href=#>wed in Bali</a>, they were never legally married, and they <a href=#>split in August 2019</a>. That same month, <a href=#>they disagreed on conceiving a baby</a> during an episode of the reality show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He always tells me that he thinks within the next year things will be a little bit better,” Carter said at the time. “How many years are we going to say this? There’s never going to be the perfect time to have kids, but I want to have them, so why not now?”</p><p>The Hills: New Beginnings airs on MTV Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmZmpubq6zWaamqqkmr9uwMSlo6xlla16qcHSm5innF2Xv7Cw2Gahnqaemr9urcGorK1loKeyqLrAp5qyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./philip-bretherton-19550530-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Philip Bretherton (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-this-is-me-then-album-ben-affleck-relevant-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J.Lo Says This Is Me Then Album For Ben Affleck Is Relevant Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
