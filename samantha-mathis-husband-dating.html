In addition, she gained popularity when she served as the former Vice President of Actors/Performers of SAG-AFTRA from 2015 to 2019.</p><p>Returning to her acting career, she is a veteran actress with 85 acting credits on her IMDb profile, including her one upcoming project: a movie titled The Georgetown Project, where she will portray the role of Jennifer Simon.</p><p>Similarly, some of her popular movies and TV shows include Super Mario Bros., Little Women, American Psycho, The Punisher, Aaron’s Way, Believe in Me, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/greys-anatomy/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Grey’s Anatomy</a>, The Strain, Being Frank, and The Clovehitch Killer.</p><p>Speaking of her recent acting credits, she portrayed the role of Taylor Mason Capital COO Sara Hammon in the TV show Billions, Val Jane in the movie 12 Desperate Hours, and Kathy Crandall in the movie Pet Sematary: Bloodlines.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>To conclude, Mathis’ career in the entertainment industry has given her immense fame and millions of fans from all over the world. And those fans are eager to dive deep into different aspects of the actress’ life, especially her love life. So, let’s dig in!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Samantha Mathis married to a husband?</h2><p>As of this writing, there are no reports that reveal Mathis is married to a husband. She has always been tight-lipped about her personal life and never talked about it on any public forums, including her interviews.</p><p>Her <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/samantham01/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram handle</a> and other social media handles also don’t give out anything about her love life. Her social media handles are filled with pictures and clips of her professional life, supporting fundraisers, and supporting the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/actor/jesse-metcalfe-now-new-movies/ rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA</a> strike.</p><p>So, it’s best to say that she is unmarried and has no spouse. But what about a boyfriend? Is she dating a partner? The answer to these questions is also the same as above, as she doesn’t seem to be dating anyone at the moment.</p><p>That said, it might be possible that she is secretly dating someone and keeping that aspect of her life hidden from the outside world. But nothing can be said with full confidence until Mathis confirms or announces her relationship in public.</p><p>Until then, it’s best to assume that her present relationship status is single. To conclude, Mathis doesn’t seem to have a husband or a boyfriend, and currently, she might be focused on her professional life rather than finding a spouse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Samantha Mathis’ relationship with River Phoenix</h2><p>While Mathis’ relationship status might be single at the moment, she was in a couple of relationships in the past. And among her former relationships, her romance with the late actor River Phoenix is probably the most high-profile.</p><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/popular/river-phoenix-relationships/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Mathis and Phoenix</a> reportedly began dating in 1992 after they met each other while working together in the movie The Thing Called Love. After dating, they usually accompanied each other to numerous public events and occasionally took vacations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/River-Phoenix-girlfriend-Samantha-Mathis.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Samantha Mathis with her boyfriend, River Phoenix, in ‘The Thing Called Love’ (Photo: Twitter)</p><p>The couple’s relationship ended after Phoenix unfortunately died at the age of 23 due to acute multiple drug intoxication. He died at 1:51 a.m. PST on October 31, 1993, after performing at The Viper Room, where Mathis was also present.</p><p>Apart from that, there aren’t many details about the couple’s relationship as they always prefer to keep things hidden from the media. However, the actress did open up a little about Phoenix and their relationship during her exclusive <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/24/it-was-too-much-loss-i-fell-apart-samantha-mathis-on-river-phoenix-and-her-career-revival rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with The Guardian</a> in 2018, almost 25 years after Phoenix’s death.</p><p>First, she explained why she chose to open up about her late boyfriend’s death after such a long time. She stated that she had buried all the things that happened with/alongside Phoenix for decades and didn’t talk about it publicly out of respect for his loved ones.</p><p>She also mentioned that she was traumatized by his death, but now, she felt the universe wanted her to talk about her late boyfriend. She recalled her first meeting with Phoenix when they were teenagers and how she felt she knew she would be together with him someday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samantha-mathis-ex-boyfriend-river-phoenix.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Samantha Mathis with her late boyfriend River Phoenix (Photo: Twitter)</p><p>She stated, “We met when we were both 19, and he bummed a cigarette off me in an LA club. This sounds incredibly cheesy, but I knew I would be with him one day. It just felt fated between us, and there was such chemistry.”</p><p>Three years later, they were cast together in The Thing Called Love, and they eventually began dating. As Mathis continued, she said, “I think we recognised something in each other.”</p><p>“We came from very different families, but perhaps there were some broken parts in each other we recognized. We found a safe harbour,” she added. She then reminisced about the days when she stayed with Phoenix and his family in Costa Rica and Florida, where they had fun doing different activities.</p><p>“We just hung out with his siblings and got to be kids. He was so good at hanging out,” she mentioned while shedding tears. Likewise, Mathis stated how much Phoenix took care of his family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“River said to me in that last year: ‘I just have to make one more movie to put away enough money so my youngest sister can go to college,'” she recalled what Phoenix told her. To summarize, Mathis and Phoenix’s relationship was filled with love and affection.</p><p>However, their togetherness was cut short due to Phoenix’s unfortunate death. After Phoenix’s death, the actress dated a few people within the entertainment industry, but those relationships didn’t last long.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Samantha Mathis’ dating history before River Phoenix</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Mathis dated a few people after Phoenix’s death, and she was also in a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.whosdatedwho.com/dating/samantha-mathis rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">few relationships</a> before falling in love with Phoenix. One of her first relationships was with fellow actor Christian Slater, whom she began dating in 1989.</p><p>They reportedly met while working together on a movie and were inseparable during their relationship. But their togetherness didn’t last long as they parted ways in 1990 due to hectic work schedules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samantha-mathis-ex-boyfriend-Christian-Slater.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Samantha Mathis with her ex-boyfriend Christian Slater (Photo: Facebook)</p><p>After her break up with Slater, she began dating John Leguizamo in 1991. As per reports, they first met at a New York social event and eventually started dating. They often attended different public events; however, they always remained tight-lipped about their romance.</p><p>Mathis and Leguizamo’s relationship was short-lived as they broke up around a year later in 1992. But despite their split, they remained close friends. Mathis then dated Phoenix, which sadly ended after the latter died in 1993.</p><p>Following that, she dated Christian Bale in 1994, reportedly for around six months, after which she started a romantic relationship with Noah Wyle in 1995. And like her previous relationships, this also lasted for about a year as they split in 1996.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Mathis then briefly dated Adam Duritz – from 2004 to 2005 – and Colin Hanks in 2009. To sum up, the actress’s love life hasn’t always been a successful one, which might be one of the reasons why she has chosen to remain single at the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A brief look into Samantha Mathis’ family life</h2><p>Born in 1970, Mathis celebrates her <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/samantha-mathis-45984.php rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">birthday</a> every year on May 12. As of this writing, she is 53 years of age. Likewise, she was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, but was primarily raised in Los Angeles.</p><p>Speaking of her parents, her father’s name is Donald Mathis, and her mother’s name is Bibi Besch. Her mother is a well-known Austrian-born actress, a reason why Samantha also took up a career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Samantha’s parents divorced due to known reasons when she was only a 2-year-toddler. After her parents’ divorce, she primarily lived with her mother, who raised her as a single mother. At the age of five, she and her mother relocated to Los Angeles.</p><p>Likewise, Samantha’s mother never wanted her to be an actress. However, Samantha was already hooked up with acting, and growing up in places known for acting only boosted her passion. At the age of 12, she ultimately decided to become an actress.</p><p>Besides this, there aren’t many details known about her family life, as she has marinated privacy over it. Furthermore, she also seems to be an only child of her parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZqyZnZa7tbTAZqSarJiewG601KyZmqaUYrGiwMinnmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyga-actually-comments-on-kylie-jenner-paternity-is-he-stormis-d.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyga Actually Comments on Kylie Jenner Paternity: Is He Stormi's Dad?!?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-nas-x-exposes-tekashi-6ix9ine-sliding-into-his-dms-this-you.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Nas X EXPOSES Tekashi 6ix9ine Sliding Into His DMs: This You???</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
