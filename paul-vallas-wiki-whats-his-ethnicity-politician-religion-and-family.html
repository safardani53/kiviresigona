Paul finished top in the first round of voting and will now progress to the runoff round. Vallas is expected to face up against incumbent Lori Lightfoot.&nbsp;Lightfoot made history four years ago when she became the first Black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago, winning all 50 wards. However, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was defeated in her re-election campaign on Tuesday.</p><p>During the epidemic, Chicago had an increase in violent crime, and voters were unsatisfied with her management of crime and police in the city. Paul Vallas, a former public school leader, and Brandon Johnson, a county board commissioner, were the two candidates that proceeded to the April 4 runoff.</p><h2>Paul Vallas’s Religion: Is He Christian Or Jewish?</h2><p>The politician has not said which faith he follows. He may be an Orthodox Christian due to his Greek-American parentage. Vallas started his work in the early 1980s as a budget analyst for the City of Chicago. He then worked as the city’s budget director and as Mayor Richard M. Daley’s chief of staff.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paul-Vallas-1.jpg alt="Paul Vallas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vallas was named CEO of the Chicago Public Schools in 1995, where he oversaw major increases in student performance, test scores, and graduation rates.
