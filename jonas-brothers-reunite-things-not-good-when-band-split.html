Now looking up almost a year later, we’re in the best place as family, which is the most important thing. From there, this music and new chapter have just been incredible.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joe, 29, shared a similar sentiment and said they first had to talk “through a lot of things” to successfully become a group again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We had to work through and understand what we were going through when we were that young,” he said. “It was interesting because for so many years we just put it under the rug. We said, ‘We’re done, let’s just try to rebuild our friendship and our relationship as brothers‘ — it just happened in its own time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kevin, 31, added that filming the documentary together was like being “forced into therapy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[It] was great because we had to have real conversations and not hold back,” he said. “So for us, it worked out in a good way.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kevin Jonas, Elvis Duran, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steven Ferdman/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A lot has changed for the brothers since their first turn as teen sensations in the 2000s, including the additions of their significant others <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Danielle Jonas</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Priyanka Chopra</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sophie Turner, </a>whom they asked to be in the epic music video for “Sucker.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think they’re starting to realize who the Jonas Brothers are now,” Kevin, who married wife Danielle in 2009, said. “I’ve always been focused on my family, while for the last five years Nick and Joe have been doing their thing, but now to come back and to be doing this as a family again, and honestly bringing them along with us, it’s going to be such a different day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Also being there to support each other in our individual lives, and then also what we care about, and not think of it as a deterrent from the group but part of it,” he continued. “It kind of shows in the video, we’re bringing our family together.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Nick, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>married Chopra in December</a>, embarked on a solo career and Joe sang lead vocals with his band DNCE following the band’s split, Kevin remained largely out of the spotlight as he welcomed his two daughters — Alena, 5, and Valentina, 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s kind of like coming out of retirement a little bit,” Kevin said. “It took time to get back into music again, doing the thing that was so much a part of our life, but now it feels so incredible to work together again. I never thought it was going to happen because when people say, ‘Things were bad’ — it was. It’s so cool to be supporting each other as individuals and to be back here now.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Addressing how it felt to play together as a band again, Nick said, “it came back naturally.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s things that are a challenge, like remembering certain lyrics, and other things, but what Joe spoke about too, the magic, I can’t stress that enough too,” he said. “The benchmarks I’ve had in my career never added up to what I had with my brothers.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the brothers, “Sucker” is just the beginning of what they have in store musically.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’ve got a lot of songs that are recorded,” Joe said. “When we figured out what the sound was going to be like — balancing Nick’s sound, DNCE’s sound, and Kevin bringing so much heart into it — has been really incredible. It was just really important to blend the three. We have 30-40 songs that we are excited to release, so I think in the next few months you’re going to hear more.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joe said in the mix with the rest of their music are songs with older influences like the Bee Gees, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Stevie Wonder</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Fleetwood Mac</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’re trying to mix it up and fuse all of our different sounds together,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To celebrate the release of “Sucker,” which Nick said he thought felt the “perfect step out” for the band, the brothers had drinks Thursday with country singer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Thomas Rhett</a> — Nick’s pal from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>their CMT Crossroads special</a> — who is in New York City to film <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Saturday Night Live</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He texted me and was like, ‘What are you guys up to, let’s hang!'” Nick said. “So we met up, had drinks and celebrated. We also did an Instagram story, but the funny thing is — and he’s going to kill me for saying this — but he didn’t have Instagram on his phone, he has to re-download it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer>the band would be reuniting</a> to release new music, revealing Nick, Joe and Kevin had a breakfast meeting at the Polo Lounge at The Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles in early February.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rumors about a reunion</a> first started popping up in January 2018, after the Jonas Brothers’ dedicated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noreferrer>Instagram account</a> was reactivated following almost five years of silence.
