They all want to get married after years of being alone or going through failed relationships. And sometimes, the experts on the show match two people who are in it for the long haul. Other times, the couples just don't work out, resulting in <a href=#>divorce</a> either on or off the show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, how many 'Married at First Sight' divorces have there been?</h2><p>The show has an overall success rate of around 20 percent. That's not terrible, but we think the show's experts would prefer to see the divorce numbers at 20 percent instead. Over the 15 full seasons so far of MAFS, 59 couples were matched together.</p><p>Of those 54, 38 couples remained married on <a href=#>Decision Day</a>. Unfortunately, after Decision Day ended and the show was over, some of those couples got divorced anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As of 2023, there are 46 couples from MAFS who've gotten divorced. Two had their marriages annulled following their time on the show. It could be worse, but again, it could be better.</p><p>The goal with MAFS is to help singles find their matches without the pressure or time constraints of meeting someone organically. For some couples, the show works. As we see, however, for others, it's not exactly the best route for them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The weddings on 'Married at First Sight' are completely real.</h2><p>The one thing you don't have to second guess is the validity of the marriages on MAFS. It wouldn't be surprising if the marriage ceremonies on MAFS were fake. But the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">weddings</a> are legit, as are the divorces that follow for some of the matched couples.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#mafs</a> has a TERRIBLE track record. They’re increasing the divorce stats all by themselves 😭</p>— Chrissy (@BrwnGrlFem) <a href=#>July 14, 2021</a></figure><p>Toward the end of each season of MAFS, the couples are faced with Decision Day, on which they decide if they want to stay together or get divorced. And the divorces that happen as a result of Decision Day are totally real too. Sometimes, though, couples stay together on the show, only to split up after their season ends.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Briana and Vincent are the only Season 12 couple who stayed together.</h2><p>A prime example of the kinds of couples who stay together on MAFS, only to divorce after they leave the season together, is Season 12. On Decision Day, three out of the five couples opted to stay together. However, after the season finished airing, two of those couples announced their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorces</a>.</p><p>And now, from Season 12, only <a href=#>Briana Myles Morales</a> and Vincent Morales are still together. In fact, in 2023, they had their first child together.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In July 2021, the couple spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> about staying together after they met on TV and admitted they have total faith in the process, despite the number of divorces within the franchise.</p><p>"Don't hold anything back because, you know, you could be holding back your forever," she said. "You have to be yourself and as long as you're displaying your authentic self, your person will come along. I wholeheartedly believe it because I have Vincent."</p><p>For some, the numbers in regards to the Married at First Sight divorces are enough to make you no longer believe in the experiment. But for others, the hope is certainly still there.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zvsiem2aZpGKzqr7SrWSsoZedwW6wyK%2Bmq5uVqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./isabel-jewell-19070719-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Isabel Jewell (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-david-lascher-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is David Lascher Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
