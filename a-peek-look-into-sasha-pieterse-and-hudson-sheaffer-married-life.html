In their relationship, the pair has experienced both highs and lows. However, since their wedding, their lives seem to be on a steadily upward track. Pieterse and Sheaffer had a kid two years ago and just relocated. To say the least, their wedding was out of a storybook. It was a romantic, joyous, opulent affair that set the tone for their life from then till today.</p><h2>Relationship of Sasha Pieterse and Her Husband</h2><p>Pieterse and her spouse met before 2015, but they have yet to discuss their initial meeting or how things began. She has, however, revealed the foundation of their connection. She was looking for five qualities in a guy in a relationship: honesty, commitment, loyalty, mutual support, open communication, and love. “I think it’s fantastic that I have all of that in him,” she remarked of her spouse in a 2017 interview with People.&nbsp;Pieterse and Sheaffer announced their engagement on December 22, 2015. “The finest day of my life,” the actress gushed on Instagram, while he simply replied, “She said yes!!!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sasha-Pieterse-1.jpg alt="Sasha Pieterse" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wedding planning started immediately as the two methodically planned their wedding. On May 27, 2018, the couple married in Castle Leslie in Glaslough, Ireland, after more than a year of planning. Their wedding was spectacular, and we’ll go into the specifics later. Exactly two years after their wedding, they were ready to share another exciting piece of news with their fans: the birth of their first child. Pieterse revealed her pregnancy with the couple’s first child on May 27, 2020.</p><p>She also mentioned that they were expecting their first child in October 2020 in the announcement. Her birth was a little later than predicted, but nothing was wrong with her. Hendrix Wade Sheaffer, their son, was born on November 6, 2020, at 5:39 a.m., weighing 7lbs 15oz. The three-person family will be residing in Nashville, Tennessee, as of July 2022. They relocated just before July.</p><h2>Sasha Pieterse and Hudson Sheaffer’s Fairytale Wedding</h2><p>Pieterse, as previously said, had everything about her wedding planned and re-planned numerous times. Many articles were published regarding the Pretty Little Liars actress’s wedding preparations and plans.<br>By April of 2017, she had already decided on her hair and cosmetics to complement her white gown. She’d limited her hairdo options down to three: a twisted baby’s breath style, a delicate dutch braid, and a sweet milkmaid-braided updo.&nbsp;Ryan Richman and Kirin Bhatty conducted her hair and makeup trials, and they would also apply her final cosmetics for her wedding.</p><p>In terms of her wedding motif, she desired an “ethereal” atmosphere for her ceremony. She wanted her venue to appear contemporary and minimalist, but with a lot of green, and she had eucalyptus, olive branches, moss, and candles in mind as décor. Her wedding gown was another item she wanted to be streamlined and simple, however, it was far not. Everything planned would have to be flawlessly completed during their Castle Leslie wedding on May 27, 2018. They were, indeed.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sasha-Pieterse.jpg alt="Sasha Pieterse" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The bride chose an off-the-shoulder Christian Siriano gown with a billowing tulle skirt. Her jewelry included a XIV Karats necklace and Zadig & Voltaire bracelets. Pieterse, as it turned out, chose none of the popular haircuts. Instead, she wore her hair loose and wavy.&nbsp;Sheaffer, for his part, donned a black suit with a white shirt beneath and styled his hair in a textured quiff, which complemented his wife’s hair and the laid-back wedding ambiance. He complemented his ensemble with black shoes and a traditional black tie. The space was just what she had envisioned: lush, open, and otherworldly.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqiVmrhuuM6oomahnqm8br%2FArJ%2BaZaCesrWx0aycZpmemXqpwcOspqdlo52yorLFnqlmpZGnv6qxw2ajop6VZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chunky-hoop-earrings.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities Are Wearing Chunky Hoop Earrings: Get the Look</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./which-character-from-cheers-are-you.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Which Character from Cheers Are You?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
