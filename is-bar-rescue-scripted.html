In fact, bar owners have spoken up about their experience, some claiming the show is definitely scripted. Here's what they have to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Even if we can't go out to bars right now, at least we can vicariously experience them through <a href=#>Bar Rescue, a reality TV show</a> that follows host Jon Taffer as the entrepreneur travels the country and transforms dingy, failing bars into upscale destinations. <a href=#>It's basically Kitchen Nightmares</a> but for bars only. While it's super entertaining (albeit stressful) to watch, fans have wondered if Bar Rescue is scripted.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the show's premiere in 2011, viewers debated whether the show's producers and editors have spiced things up a bit for entertainment value. If you've been watching Bar Rescue all these years, then you'll probably know Jon meets some pretty out-there folks who have major issues — not only with their bars, but their personnel, person lives, and more. Even Jon himself is portrayed as a blunt, no sh*ts given kind of guy who isn't afraid of confronting anyone. This sometimes results in fights and heated arguments.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Network</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, could Bar Rescue really be scripted?</h2><p>It's true that most reality TV shows offer guidance (if not very, very heavy guidance) when filming. Editors will cut the boring parts and emphasize on exciting moments, even though they may be out of context. In the case of Bar Rescue, it's definitely possible some of the show is even scripted. In 2014, a guest on the show says he was told to flirt with Jon's wife and then was physically attacked by Jon. According to Deadline, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest sustained injuries</a> that he had to go to the hospital for, and he ended up filing a lawsuit against the production company.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Network</span></figure><p>Another example is the 2016 episode that features <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nina Wyatt's Schafer's Bar and Grill</a>. She claimed that she was fed lines that didn't exactly align with the true story. The new owner of the bar, Ryan Burks stated, "During my first interview I was asked how much money we are losing each month. My exact words to the producer were, 'What would you like me to say?' Producer's response: 'For our story you are losing $10,000 a month and losing your house and closing down next month.' All of which isn't true."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Network</span></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">owner of Piratz Tavern</a> also said, "It was basically coerced and staged to be an opening act for a re-rescue. I was told to bring in several changes of clothes to make it appear that filming covered several days. As usual they brought in a bunch of extras to fill the house and we were told what to say and with whom to speak."</p><p>Even a redditor who claimed they were familiar with one of the bars featured on the show wrote, "...having known a bar that went through the show process, it is largely fake in the sense, the bar and the surroundings are largely not what the show portrays them as." There have also been several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a> that have described their accounts, stating Bar Rescue's portrayal is totally inaccurate and at times, fabricated.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Jon Taffer, nor the network have confirmed or denies that Bar Rescue is scripted. Does knowing that Bar Rescue is most likely at least a little fudged make it any less entertaining? Eh, probably not. Watch new episodes of Bar Rescue every Sunday at 10 p.m. on Paramount Network.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBursCrZKudo5jCpnnSnKmiqKSasQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bri-winkler.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bri Winkler Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./price-is-right-model-shane-stirling-files-lawsuit-claims-she-was-fired-for-getting-pregnant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Price is Right' Model Shane Stirling Files Lawsuit, Claims She Was Fired for Getting Pregnant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
