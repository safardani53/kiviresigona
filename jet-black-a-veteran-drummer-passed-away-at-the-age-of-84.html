In 1974, he formed The Stranglers with vocalist Hugh Cornwell. He was a member of the band until 2015, when he announced his retirement.&nbsp;Jet‚Äôs health problems have always had an adverse effect on his performance. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in 2007 and was unable to go outside of the United Kingdom for performances since it may have exacerbated his health difficulties. The next year, he had chest difficulties and had to restrict his workload.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jet-Black-1.jpg alt="Jet Black" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2012, Black was hospitalized with a chest ailment and had to cancel a tour. He was warned not to go outside of the UK, so he had to skip a few occasions. He made a few performances in 2014, and his last one was at the Cambridge Corn Exchange in 2015. He continued to travel with The Stranglers until his departure in 2018. The English rock band is best renowned for its number-one albums and songs. They rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s with songs such as No More Heroes, Always the Sun, Big Thing Coming, and others. Jean-Jacques Burnel, Baz Warne, Jim Macaulay, and Toby Hounsham are current members of the band.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jet-Black-2.jpg alt="Jet Black" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hans Warmling, a member of the original lineup, died in a boating accident in October 1995. Dave Greenfield, another member, died two years ago after being diagnosed with Covid-19. Following the departure of Hugh Cornwell, Black avoided communication with members of the band. Jet Black, in addition to being a superb guitarist, also penned two novels, Much Ado About Nothing and Seven Days in Nice.&nbsp;Until his death, Black lived in Tetbury, Gloucestershire. His wife Ava, as well as their children Charlotte and Anthony, survive.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqxdl7mir8pmmGaulamys63NZpurrZ2isrN5z5qqrJ2UYq64rdhmmK1lpJ2ybq3GnmSonl1tgXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nigel-farage-reason-im-a-celeb-fee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigel Farage reveals secret reason he did Im A Celeb - and it wasnt the 1.5m fee</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gina-kirschenheiter-weight-loss-diet-workout-advice-rhoc-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Gina Kirschenheiter Discusses Weight Loss &amp;amp; Fitness Tips: Interview Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
