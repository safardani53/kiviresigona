The long-running bravo series finished season 17 which was called the show’s best season in years, due in part to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tamra Judge</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vicki Gunvalson</a></strong>‘s epic returns. While fans expected the full cast to be back for season 18, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Armstrong</strong></a> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced</a> on November 29 that she’s leaving the show after appearing as a “Friend Of” on season 17. Taylor, an original cast member on <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>,&nbsp;made Real Housewives history when she crossed over franchises.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Here is everything you need to know about&nbsp;RHOC&nbsp;season 18.</p><h2>RHOC&nbsp;Season 18 Premiere Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4><i>RHOC&nbsp;</i>will not return for season 18 until 2024. Filming is expected to being sometime after the season 17 reunion concludes on October 11. The latest season of the show filmed during the fall months of 2022, which could be the case for season 18. So don’t count on watching season 18 until the middle of next year, at the earliest.</p><h2>RHOC&nbsp;Season 18 Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rhoc-season-18-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fans will learn the&nbsp;RHOC&nbsp;season 18 cast once filming gets going. After a dynamite season, there’s demand that all six full-time cast members — Tamra Judge, Shannon Beador, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Heather Dubrow</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emily Simpson</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Pedranti</strong> </a>&nbsp;return for season 18. Fans also want to see Vicki Gunvalson back in a greater capacity, after she made several guest appearances during season 17.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Taylor announced her exit from the franchise on November 29. “L<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">oved spending time with the ladies of </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#RHOC</span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> and thankful I got to give the viewers an update on my life,” she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> on Twitter. “I’ve made some real friendships that I cherish. Wishing the ladies all the best for season 18. P.S. Adding season 17 to my IMDb.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Of all the full-time cast members, Heather’s return is the least guaranteed. She had a rough go during season 17 and sparked speculation that she’d leave the show to join <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> after she bought a house in Los Angeles. However, Heather has put it out there that she she wants to continue on RHOC.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I am very grateful for this platform and so you know what?

I would think that she will,” Emily said. “First of all, that was a year ago and I do think that as women, as professionals, when you get to step back and analyze it and think about things, you realize that there are certain circumstances that aren’t normal when you’re all put together and it’s a pressure cooker and it’s hot and we’re tired and there’s no break and we haven’t eaten and I think when you step away from it, you do realize that this person overreacted, I overreacted, it’s a lot.”</p><h2>Shannon Beador’s Legal Troubles</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Shannon Beador might bring the most intriguing storyline to&nbsp;RHOC&nbsp;season 18 with her recent legal troubles. On September 16, Shannon <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made headlines</a>&nbsp;after she drove her car into a residential property in Newport Beach, CA and “clipped” the house, per law enforcement sources. She then reportedly drove back on the road and parked her car in the middle of the street before getting out of the car with her dog. Authorities arrived at the scene shortly after, and Shannon “tried to act like she was taking a walk,” sources told TMZ. But the police knew she was at fault because <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she “appeared wasted,”&nbsp;</a>according to the report.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rhoc-season-18-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Shannon was taken into custody and booked for two misdemeanors, a DUI and a hit-and-run after her arrest, according to TMZ. She was reportedly cited and released without bond. The car she was driving was also reportedly seized by the police to be used in an investigation. The incident occurred over a week after the season 17 reunion filmed on September 7.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>After the arrest, Shannon shared a public apology in a statement released by her lawyer,&nbsp;<strong>Michael Fell</strong>. “I spent quite a bit of time with Shannon yesterday. She is extremely apologetic and remorseful,” he said on September 18. “We will be awaiting the official information on this case as it becomes available, and Shannon is prepared to accept full responsibility for her actions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GemKVlmKTCtLHWoq2eq12ks2670ZqloJ1dmLy2utOyZKugn5h6tLHArKanZWFteqbCxKuwraCZo7Ruw8Rmoqenp2KCcoKWbmluZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carrie-fisher-toxicology-report-complicates-cause-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toxicology Report Complicates Cause of Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rashad-wright.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rashad Wright</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
