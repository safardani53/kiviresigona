There’s a fine line between looking airbrushed and looking cakey when trying full-coverage <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>foundation</a>, but it's no surprise that this age-old makeup product is the secret behind some of Hollywood’s most flawless faces.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This type of foundation aims to minimize pores and blemishes as well as correct tone for a more even base. In today's era of skin-first makeup and dewy, natural finishes, it’s not incredibly common for makeup artists to employ the use of full coverage products, but that’s not to say this practice is extinct.&nbsp;And for makeup-users, sometimes you feel more comfortable in something that disguises elements of your skin that perhaps make you a bit self-conscious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a myriad of foundations (and tons of shades available for each) to discover in the full-coverage space, so we took to the PEOPLE Tested lab to decide which products deserve the space on your beauty counter.

This liquid foundation was made to be a hybrid between skincare and makeup to craft a complexion that looks as healthy as it feels.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Formulated with ingredient complexes that aim to hydrate the skin and refine wrinkles, this foundation felt nourishing when applied on the tester’s skin and was able to cover almost all of their imperfections with just two pumps. They appreciated the way this foundation felt locked in on their skin without creating dryness, as there was no color transfer when blotted and the formula stayed put while being blended with a sponge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this product is supposed to help moisturization, our tester did feel like the results were slightly drying. However, this didn’t become a deterrent in the end, as they shared that they “would sacrifice additional moisture for staying power and transfer resistance.” Our tester also noted that this would be a great formula for those with naturally oily skin — ensuring a matte finish, strong staying power and smoothed texture for any skin type.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>30 ml | <strong>Shades:</strong> 44 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Matte | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>Balanced, dry, combination</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-nyx-total-control-pro-drop-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Drugstore</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Total Control Pro Drop Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=nyx-total-control-pro-drop-foundation style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qcH2u59l3k0fg3jvbsuknpvLUG0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-total-control-pro-drop-foundation-6647e88824464220aee8cd3762e5bd6f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The NYX Total Control Pro Drop Foundation is the perfect lightweight, buildable option for someone who wants to achieve a full-glam look without spending too much money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It only took our testers four pumps of the dropper to get enough foundation to cover their skin in a texture-smoothing, tone-evening sheen. The lightweight formula “had a shine to it, but didn’t look oily — it looked healthy,” said our tester after blending the foundation, which blurred effortlessly without creasing or pilling up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to its wide variety of shade options, our tester was able to find a hue that perfectly matched their skin tone from the neck-up. While they did experience transfer when they blotted their skin with an oil blotting sheet, they still felt that the look was beautiful — remaining free of creases and smudges, even after repeatedly touching the face. For a drugstore price, this foundation has some serious power.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.43 ounces | <strong>Shades:</strong> 29 | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1782 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Total Control Pro Drop Foundation" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tHxLzSX6VLoNCBOTINyt6mlWcgE=/fit-in/1500x1782/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-nyx-total-control-pro-drop-foundation-jjuliao-7114-54987e3b3589474e98f5620c6c3fe229.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2809 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Total Control Pro Drop Foundation" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/TWc8cxd3GkY8SyhSw4ygojKAAlw=/fit-in/1500x2809/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-full-coverage-foundation-test-nyx-total-control-pro-drop-jjuliao-6702-d131a989b1914ad4b31e65461702e23f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-chantecaille-future-skin-cushion-skincare-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantecaille Future Skin Cushion Skincare Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bluemercury Chantecaille Future Skin Cushion Skincare Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JAz4jCTwA78Y_8Yp64JGzBBlSds=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Future-Skin-Cushion-Skincare-Foundation-e33ad09a2e064b2985c6f503bb702272.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bluemercury</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Coverage</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Finish</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Ultra lightweight</p></li><li><p>Glowy finish</p></li><li><p>Tone-evening</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Small shade range</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Glamor is the name of Chantecaille’s game, and their Future Skin Cushion Skincare Foundation is no exception. This stunning foundation glides seamlessly onto the skin thanks to its hydrating, water-based formula and provides a healthy glow that the wearer can boast all day long thanks to the staying power our tester made note of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The lightweight product had just enough pigmentation to cover our tester’s redness but was never cakey on the skin or settled into wrinkles, a quality that they especially appreciated. They went so far as to call the semi-matte finish “impeccable,” later stating that they had “never felt a foundation this light that actually provided coverage” without feeling like they were wearing a full face of products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only wish is that there were more shades to choose from, as this delectable formula should be felt by everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.42 ounces | <strong>Shades:</strong> 8 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Semi-matte | <strong>Skin type: </strong>All</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2462 data-sizes=750px alt="Best Full Coverage Foundations" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/eWXSfWbFnniNSheoIVkDnT0fw6g=/fit-in/1500x2462/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-chantecaille-future-skin-cushion-skincare-foundation-jjuliao-7094-bff6423d923d4421bdb562da6dae7516.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2724 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantecaille Future Skin Cushion Skincare Foundation" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sfPSYQH9xks1i6Vg1prkUYqSWsw=/fit-in/1500x2724/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-full-coverage-foundation-test-chantecaille-future-skin-cushion-skincare-jjuliao-6160-251375cc0ddd4764b1d1c44297b6c275.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stick-nudestix-nudies-tinted-blur-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Stick</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nudestix Nudies Tinted Blur Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Nudestix Nudies Tinted Blur Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/oIhrOtJmU8g0uhVFqelesurQYJk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nudestix-nudies-tinted-blur-stick-efe1ba564ddf4b5d80ca09a0cfbcc285.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Coverage</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Finish</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Buildable coverage</p></li><li><p>Blurring</p></li><li><p>Evens discoloration</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all foundations are made the same, and this definitely rings true for the Nudestix Tinted Blur Foundation. Pivoting from liquid products, this stick foundation allows you to work up to the level of coverage that you want thanks to its buildable and easy-to-blend formula.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester especially liked that it was able to easily cover their discoloration with just a few taps of their fingers or brush, two methods that worked to effortlessly blend the foundation onto their skin. Since the product is a stick, its formula is naturally denser than liquid versions, meaning it was able to minimize pores and blur the skin easier than liquid foundations can.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester did feel as if the formula was on the slightly drying side over time (as most full-coverage products are), so they suggested the use of a great moisturizer before applying the foundation for the best results. This foundation should be on everyone’s radar thanks to its versatility, from the light coverage-lover to the full-coverage fan.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.42 ounces | <strong>Shades:</strong> 11 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Semi-matte | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2984 data-sizes=750px alt="Best Full Coverage Foundations" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wf6Mk5aTxYajdeXxzjtO6XyZUmI=/fit-in/1500x2984/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-nudestix-tinted-blur-foundation-stick-jjuliao-0716-a69411335ed343c3891eca88bfd4201e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2664 data-sizes=750px alt="Nudestix Tinted Blur Foundation Stick" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lEQPlKizxU7l3Aht5gVorhzFglQ=/fit-in/1500x2664/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-full-coverage-foundation-test-nudestix-tinted-blur-stick-jjuliao-6680-4c6a46413af247d5876d90f2026511d1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spf-kosas-revealer-skin-improving-foundation-spf-25></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best SPF</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kosas Revealer Foundation SPF 25</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Kosas Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5hw6lGhKUiC-EzmtNNKewpm_Ra8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/169-fb589844fd7b424eb6cd9aa0fd59ba4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Coverage</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Finish</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>UV protection</p></li><li><p>Natural finish</p></li><li><p>A little goes a long way</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Slightly pricey</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We all know the importance of wearing our sunscreen, but did you ever think to incorporate it into your makeup routine?

The coveted ‘no make-up makeup’ look unlocked,” they praised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the price point is quite high compared to some other foundations, we do think this foundation is well worth the investment thanks to its skincare benefits and glow-y results. “I usually opt for tinted moisturizers and concealer, but this foundation has me changing my mind,” our tester raved. For the skincare-conscious, this foundation will be a no-brainer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 ounce | <strong>Shades:</strong> 23 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Natural | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>All</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1902 data-sizes=750px alt="KOSAS Revealer Skin Improving SPF 25 Foundation" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UIbkzy57FvJtoWWpOifyMOXBtw0=/fit-in/1500x1902/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-kosas-revealer-skin-improving-spf-25-foundation-jjuliao-7107-3fa0641688ef40e79d8c2aeb2123f513.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2724 data-sizes=750px alt="KOSAS Revealer Skin Improving SPF 25 Foundation" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BVtxohmz0YcHFOoOrcwUZz4St-o=/fit-in/1500x2724/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-full-coverage-foundation-test-kosas-revealer-skin-improving-spf-25-jjuliao-6465-7d77f8288b3e4eabadea66a8248e9d36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-este-lauder-double-wear-stay-in-place-matte-powder-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Powder</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Estée Lauder Double Wear Powder Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Est&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;e Lauder Double Wear Stay In Place Matte Powder Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2xyLFx8bJ8GZ1PBLVbrB7tYHheU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Double-Wear-Stay-In-Place-Matte-Powder-Foundation-4debe4941cc74268bd9cddc5ed1cbfc7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Coverage</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Finish</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ve seen liquid and stick foundations, but let us introduce you to the best powder for full coverage: the Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Matte Powder Foundation. This pressed powder has more than 30 shades in order to match as many skin tones as possible and feels lightweight on the skin thanks to its finely-pressed formula.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After some testing, our volunteers found favor with this comfortable foundation that blended easily onto their skin and felt light enough to wear during the summer for breathability and shine control.

The Fenty Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation is the secret ingredient to oil-controlled skin with its climate-adaptive formula that resists the buildup of sweat, shine, and oil on the skin when exposed to heat or after long hours of wear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers immediately noticed how lightweight and easy to blend this formula was, even stating that it “doesn’t even feel like there’s makeup on,” making this an easy product to reach for everyday. There was very little transfer onto the blotting sheet as well, which means that this product’s staying power is no joke.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though this product will last you all day, you may prefer its use for more natural makeup days, as its pigmentation is not as full coverage as it claims. Our tester with hyperpigmentation felt as if they would need several more layers of the product to get a true full-coverage effect, but that this was a beautiful product for those looking for medium/buildable coverage (or anyone who doesn’t have dark circles or spots). Long, sweaty days in the summer are no foe to the Fenty Pro Filt’r.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.08 ounces | <strong>Shades:</strong> 56 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Matte | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>Oily, combination, balanced</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="The Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation displayed on a oval shaped plate on a marble tabletop" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Sra6gL_BUJ4NVhGnixLITZtp0Yg=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PPL-Fenty-Beauty-by-0Rihanna-Pro-Filtr-Soft-Matte-Longwear-Liquid-Foundation-TamaraStaples-0507-a874a0794a9c45a38d460e20fc3c4b25.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2809 data-sizes=750px alt="Person applying Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation to their face" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/v_2f3bdU9Xj8w3n5bxP_HQF-uro=/fit-in/1500x2809/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-full-coverage-foundation-test-fenty-pro-filtr-soft-matte-longwear-liquid-jjuliao-6365-d4d8bd13ab6b4d82884ccac413896077.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-buildable-coverage-ilia-true-skin-serum-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Buildable Coverage</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ILIA True Skin Serum Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ilia True Skin Serum Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Dy4s1VpDU5Ij-9kdETFuKQs5FxU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ilia-True-Skin-Serum-Foundation-978d718dff3f4c839699caf43e191576.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Coverage</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Finish</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Radiant, skin-like finish</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Very blendable and customizable coverage</p></li><li><p>Non-oxidizing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the biggest deterrents for people when it comes to full coverage foundations is the fear of looking cake-y or the skin drying out, which is why a buildable product is one of the better options for customizable coverage. The Ilia True Skin Serum Foundation hits the mark with its medium coverage formula made with niacinamide to not only provide a finish that feels as healthy as it looks, but can be easily layered for more coverage, if necessary.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even after applying a few layers of the product, our tester was impressed by the weightlessness of this product and its ability to cover up redness and pores while still producing a dewy, natural finish. They felt that they would still need to use a powder to set the foundation in their naturally oily areas, like the T-zone, but that the glow-y foundation was easily blendable, highly breathable, and produced a “texture that felt like silk.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like most of the products in this test, this foundation transferred slightly onto the blotting sheet used, but only left product-produced oil on the sheet and kept the foundation mostly intact on their skin. Because this formula doesn’t oxidize either, it’s perfect for all-day wear — meaning you can wear a little during the day for a natural look and boost the coverage for a night out without the fear of yellowing or cakiness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 ounce | <strong>Shades:</strong> 30 | <strong>Finish:</strong> Natural | <strong>Skin Type: </strong>Oily, combination, balanced</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-weightless-pat-mcgrath-labs-skin-fetish-sublime-perfection-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Weightless</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pat McGrath Labs Sublime Perfection Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Pat McGrath Labs Skin Fetish Sublime Perfection Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/88wbuTxZIAVKP-aC9U6VKlCI5dQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Pat-McGrath-Labs-Skin-Fetish-Sublime-Perfection-Foundation-ad185b782eb9431a917ba78bd15a1b71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Coverage</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Finish</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Slight creasing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a skin-perfecting foundation that feels like you’re wearing no makeup at all, then look no further than the Pat McGrath Sublime Perfection Foundation.

Our tester attributed this lightness to its water-based formula, which made the product feel like a tinted serum instead of a thick foundation, making it “ideal for everyday wear or days that you want a second skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After wearing the foundation for a good amount of time, our tester noticed a bit of creasing at their smile lines, but this was to be expected as the foundation hadn’t been set with powder — a staple in most beauty routines. Our tester still loved how this product both looked and felt on their face, stating that their “skin looks truly glorious” and was truly worth the investment (its price tag is not cheap).

Those with dry skin will want to look for a foundation that has moisturizing components rather than shine-reducing properties, which usually do a little more leg-work to restrict oil production in the skin, thus leading to dry patches and the dreaded cake-y look. On the other hand, however, people with naturally oily skin will want to opt for a shine-reducing or sweat-resistant formula, like that of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fenty Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation</a>, which is made to keep your makeup from turning into a greasy finish.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers came into the lab with fresh faces, but still cleaned their skin with a makeup wipe to remove any buildup of oil or sebum that may have been produced on the commute. Each volunteer then tested their moisture levels with a moisture reader, recording their hydration levels before and after foundation application. They then applied moisturizer, waited until it was absorbed, and applied the foundation of their choosing with either a makeup sponge, brush, or their fingers. After the first layer, they examined their skin for coverage, evenness, and feel. They then reapplied layers until their desired coverage was met and analyzed the final results after ten to fifteen minutes of drying time. Once the makeup was fully dried, they rated its performance on the categories of coverage, texture, wear, finish, and transfer resistance, rating each on a scale of one to five (with five being the best). Each tester evaluated their moisture levels one last time to see if the product had in fact increased or decreased their hydration levels and took this into consideration as well, based on the product and what it promised.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-6eec9822-081a-4dab-aad2-4c4913eb74de></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How can you apply full-coverage foundation without looking cakey?</span></p><p>Babsky offers his tips for ensuring perfectly blended makeup when using a thicker product: "If I have to apply a full-coverage foundation, I spend a lot of time preparing the skin, cleansing and moisturizing to give a supple, fresh complexion into which I can really blend out a fuller coverage seamlessly — skin that’s too dry will end up looking cake-y with a full coverage over it," he explains. "I also like to apply the foundation with my fingers so that I can really fuse it firmly with the skin and ensure it’s not just sitting on top of it."</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What’s the difference between regular foundation and full-coverage foundation?</span></p><p>Most foundations aim to even your skin tone and make your skin look like skin but better, and full-coverage foundations pack a little more of a punch. These formulas tend to be a bit thicker or at least more pigmented than your run-of-the-mill foundation, correcting dark spots, hyperpigmentation, blemishes and more with a small amount of the product. This potent type of product is meant to be used lightly, or you can use a medium-coverage foundation and layer it to build up the level of coverage.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When should you wear full-coverage foundation?</span></p><p>While there are no rules as to when and where you can wear certain types of makeup, you may feel more drawn to one product over another depending on the occasion. For many people, a simple tinted moisturizer or medium-coverage foundation will be perfect for their day-to-day, as this feels more casual and (usually) feels lightweight on their skin. But if you’re getting ready for an event where there may be pictures taken, you may want to opt for a matte-finish, full-coverage foundation if you have blemishes and discoloration you're looking to hide.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alyssa Brascia</a> is a commerce writer for PEOPLE, specializing in beauty, fashion, home, and lifestyle products.
