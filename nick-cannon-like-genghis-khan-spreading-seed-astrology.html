who welcomed his 12th child today with model Alyssa Scott - to Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan who had so many children that he has 16 million descendants alive today.</p><p>And like Khan, she believes that the rapper is more interested in "spreading his seed" than creating kids "from a place of love."</p><p>Shaina says the reason Cannon, who has had 12 children with six women since 2011, has had so many kids is down to his <a href=#>star sign</a> and his astrological 'houses' - where the planets and constellations were the day and time you were born.</p><p>The astrologer said that the fifth of Nick's twelve houses - the one connected with procreation and how many children one will have - had an unusually large cluster of planets, known as a "stellium", which typically indicates a very large family.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ASTROLOGY">READ MORE ASTROLOGY</h2><p>In other words, of all his <a href=#>chart</a> houses, his fifth house is where the party is at.</p><p>"Nick Cannon’s chart has such a major 5th house stellium that it doesn’t really matter the current transits and progressions going through his chart-he always has so much potent energy to have kids.</p><p>"However, with outer planets moving through his 11th house," the one that rules a person's relationship with the world, "it feels as though he views children not as individuals but as a way to create his own, personal network," she continued.</p><p>"Similar to how I think of Genghis Khan spreading his seed.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Especially because Nick Cannon’s chart has so many religious connotations, if he has children it is not from a place of love and creation, but rather a place of feeling it is his spiritual duty to repopulate the earth with himself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/actor-nick-cannon-lights-empire-620929862.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/nick-cannon-welcomes-10th-child-764749123.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/nick-cannon-seen-december-24-784807116.jpg><p>Shaina added that people with fifth house stelliums "are also known for having huge egos."</p><p>There are deeper reasons, <a href=#>astrologically</a>-speaking, why Nick apparently feels the need to express a potent masculine energy by bearing children in the double digits, according to the astrologer.</p><p>"His Scorpio Mars is also very active in his natal chart - Scorpio wants ownership and Mars is sexual energy - which makes him want to 'claim' women by impregnating them.</p><p>"With it in the 6th house," that of work and health "he does so with such a high level of impersonal feelings towards the woman."</p><p>And apparently, this self-motivation is unlikely to slow down any time soon.</p><p>"As long as the woman is a hot commodity (stereotypically attractive), he probably feels it is his job to use her body to push along his own personal agenda of more of himself.&nbsp;"&nbsp;</p><h2>KIDS IN THE CANNON</h2><p>Nick Cannon has <a href=#>12 children from a few different baby mamas</a>, and today he welcomed his 12th child with model&nbsp;<a href=#>Alyssa Scott</a>.</p><p>She is a girl named Halo Marie Cannon.</p><p>On November 11, 2022, <a href=#>Abby De La Rosa</a>&nbsp;gave birth to their third child together.</p><p>He also has two children with ex-wife Mariah Carey.</p><p>Their twins, Monroe and Moroccan Scott, were born on April 30, 2011.

They can be found by checking the time and date of your birth.</p><p>To determine zodiac houses for an individual's birth chart, the sky is divided into twelve sections which each represent a personality aspect or different part of life. The position of the planets will change in the chart as the Earth rotates.</p><p>Depending upon where planets are in the sky at the moment of birth, said celestial bodies are thought to occupy that house and have direct influence on the themes associated with that house.</p><p>House rulership, on the other hand, depends on what <a href=#>zodiac</a> sign falls into that section of the 360-degree chart, and the planet associated with the sign.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For example, if your 7th house is in Leo, the Sun, the planetary body associated with that zodiac sign, rules your 7th house, no matter where the Sun is in your chart.</p><p>Get your own personal astrology reading done by Shaina on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Freak</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYGWCeYOWaKWim5tisKK6zailZqSZoLJus8SnnqGho2K4qa3NZqqpqpWWsaq6xmaqnp2UYq60wNGoo6ifqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-history-of-pippa-middletons-suitors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pippa Middleton: A History Of The Famous Bridesmaid's Suitors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-staals-wife-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Staals Wife: Who is Marc Staal Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riann-steele-debris-html.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-dawah-19890406-html.html>Ali Dawah (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irina-shabayeva.html>Fame | Irina Shabayeva net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mil-mascaras.html>Mil Mascaras</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-romance-201343.html>Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes' Relationship Timeline</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
